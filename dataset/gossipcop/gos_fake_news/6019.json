    "text": "As the release of the musical sequel on DVD and Blu - ray is confirmed for November 26, one of the featurettes has been teased early. In it, fans can see the making of Super Trouper ; the big ensemble show - stopper that comes right at the end of the film. This featurette sees the male stars joking about their embarrassment, with Stellan Skarsgard - who plays the older Bill - saying : “ I can ’ t sing, I can ’ t dance and I don ’ t know why they hired me for this. “ It ’ s probably just to humiliate me! ”"
