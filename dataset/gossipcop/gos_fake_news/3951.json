The couple was spotted in the audience genuinely freaking out when Taylor played the clip of their three - year - old daughter James ’ voice, which kicks off her song “ Gorgeous. ” Blake was seen recording the moment on her phone and the two cheered when they heard their toddler over the speakers. Taylor previously confirmed it was James ’ voice on the track in the liner notes for Reputation. Blake and Ryan were joined at the show by Taylor ’ s other bestie, Gigi Hadid. All three were later spotted singing along to Taylor ’ s song “ Dress, ” with Gigi even dropping to her knees at one point. Copyright © 2018"
