Kim posted a lengthy Facebook message to fans explaining that he decided to leave the show after contract negotiations with the network failed. Kim and Park reportedly had been seeking equal pay with stars Alex O ’ Loughlin and Scott Caan. CBS, in turn, responded with a statement saying the network offered the duo “ large and significant salary raises. ” In response, Lenkov addressed H50 fans directly in his message on Twitter, explaining that both actors were offered “ unprecedented raises ”"
