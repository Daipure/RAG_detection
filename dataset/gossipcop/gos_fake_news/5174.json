    "text": "The Rock And Jason Statham's Furious Spinoff Landed The Perfect Director By Adam Holmes Random Article Blend Dwayne Johnson's Luke Hobbs and Jason Statham's Deckard Shaw were adversaries during Furious 7, and their feud continued into The Fate of the Furious, but as that latter movie chugged along, the two found themselves working together to bring down Charlize Theron's Cipher. Rather than keep their dynamic going in another of the main Fast and the Furious movies, Universal gave the green light to a spinoff movie starring Hobbs and Shaw, which is reportedly being called... well, Hobbs and Shaw, and now it's official : Deadpool 2 director David Leitch will helm that spinoff. It was reported back in early February"
