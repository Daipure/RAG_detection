    "text": "Whatever prompted Warner Bros. to send home the cast of “ Bachelor in Paradise ” could change reality television — but not in the ways you might expect. The studio said on Sunday that it has halted production on the popular ABC unscripted series in the middle of Season 4 following “ allegations of misconduct ” and that an investigation is underway. It appears to involve questions about whether a sexual encounter occurred between two cast members, and whether one of them was too inebriated to give consent. Mike Johansson, a senior lecturer for the School of Communication at the Rochester Institute of Technology who has closely followed reality shows, believes that viewers will continue to tune into the “ Bachelor ” franchise, even if something terrible occurred.
