    "text": "With ABC ’ s Once Upon a Time wrapping its sixth season this spring, the network and the show ’ s creators Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis had been discussing a potential seventh season that would reimagine the fairytale drama. I hear that a potential new installment is looking to shake things up, focusing on four of the most popular characters on the show. I hear ABC Studios, which produces Once, is in talks with original cast members Jennifer Morrison ( Emma ), Lana Parrilla ( Regina ), Robert Carlyle ( Mr. Gold ) as well as Colin O ’ Donoghue ( Hook ), who has been a staple on the show for the past few seasons, about a potential Season 7. The list does not include Ginnifer Goodwin ( Mary ), Josh Dallas ( David ) and Jared Gilmore"
