Kanye and Kim Kardashian took their little ones on a trip to the famous San Diego Zoo on Thursday and Kim made sure to document all the adorable moments on her Instagram. The Kardashian - Wests even got up close and personal with the animals as North got to feed an elephant a piece of lettuce before posing for the cutest photo op. The 4 - year - old also got to pose with a hippopotamus. While North and Saint captured some scrapbook - worthy memories, there was no sign of their 11 - week - old daughter, Chicago West."
