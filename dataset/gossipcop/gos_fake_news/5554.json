( Photo : White House Photo by Andrea Hanks ) President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump posed for their 2018 official White House Christmas portrait in a hall crowded with green Christmas trees laden with red ornaments. The photo, by official Trump White House photographer Andrea Hanks, shows POTUS and FLOTUS holding hands, standing surrounded by conventionally green trees â€“ not the blood - red conical trees designed by the first lady that inspired a Twitter kerfuffle a few weeks ago. Judging from the first lady's sleek white turtleneck gown by Celine, the photo was taken in the Cross Hall during the annual Congressional Ball at the White House Saturday night. Merry"
