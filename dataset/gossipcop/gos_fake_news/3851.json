According to the curvy model who has been dating 21 Savage for almost year, she is not calling herself ` ` single'' yet just that she's currently having issues with her man and hopes they work things out. ` ` Am I single?'' Rose said on REAL 92. 3 L. A.'s Big Boy Neighborhood on Friday. ` ` To be in a relationship in general is very difficult. To be famous and in a relationship is even more difficult because you have, like, teams and people and everybody feeding ya'll both stuff and then you wind up arguing about things"
