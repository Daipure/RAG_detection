Charlotte was captured repeatedly waving to the crowd from the steps of St. George's Chapel. The 3 - year - old daughter of Prince William and Kate Middleton served as a bridesmaid in the wedding, while her brother Prince George was a page boy. This isn ’ t the first time we ’ ve caught a glimpse of Charlotte ’ s royal wave. As she visited her new baby brother, Prince Louis, at St. Mary's hospital in London earlier this year, she adorably waved at the crowd gathered outside. The youngest members of the bridal party donned outfits by Amaia, one of Kate's preferred children's clothing brands. Eugenie, 28, wed Jack Brooksbank"
