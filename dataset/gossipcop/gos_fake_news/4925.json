    "text": "A very interesting story - line will be released episodes by epidoses soon. It is a story that was chronicled around a Nigerian family life in the southwestern part of the country that started not quite long after the Nigerian Civil War was halted in 1970. It promised to keep your eyes openned with you being glued to the stable of wordsmithscribe. You can avoid to have your eyes waterered and teary. DISCLAIMER ; The contents of the story and all the names of the characters are purely work of imagination and fiction. It has no resemblance to any story or the names of anybody dead or alive. Any coincidence should not be taken personal. It is simply a work of fiction triggered by the figments of the author imaginative prowess. Thanks. FADEYI F"
