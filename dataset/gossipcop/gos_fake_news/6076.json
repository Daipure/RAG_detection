Eyewitnesses tell us Meghan attempted to be as incognito as possible - - with 4 bodyguards in tow - - when she entered the VFS Global UK Visa Application Centre Thursday in Chicago. We're told she was there to finalize her application for a UK visa. The whole thing only took about 10 minutes, and the entire office was cleared for her. We're told she was friendly with the staff. As for her disguise - - shades and a White Sox cap to blend in"
