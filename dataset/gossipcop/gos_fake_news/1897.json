    "text": "Move over, Scarlet Speedster, Iris West is taking over as the Flash. As EW previously teased, Iris ( Candice Patton ) will be temporarily suiting up on The Flash — and now we know why! In the upcoming March 13 episode, Team Flash confronts a new bus meta, Matthew ( Leonardo Nam ). Otherwise known as Melting Pot, the meta has the ability to swap people ’ s DNA. During a battle with the team, Matthew transfers Barry ’ s ( Grant Gustin ) super speed to Iris, giving her the powers of the Flash. Hence, when a new threat is unleashed on Central City, Barry must act as the team leader, while Iris takes over as a speedster in order to defeat their new foe. The episode is aptly titled “ Run, Iris, Run. ” Katie"
