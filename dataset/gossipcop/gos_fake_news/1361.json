Ally Sheedy, who starred in The Breakfast Club and St. Elmo's Fire, appeared to accuse the Golden Globes of hypocrisy for awarding Franco with Best Actor in a Musical - Comedy for The Disaster Artist. Taking to Twitter with a series of cryptic ( now deleted ) tweets, Sheedy questioned why the star of The Deuce was even allowed to attend the event. ` ` Why is a man hosting? Why is James Franco allowed in? Said too much. Nite love ya # goldenglobes,'' Sheedy wrote"
