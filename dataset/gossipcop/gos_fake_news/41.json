    "text": "Charlize Theron has officially weighed in on the possibility of playing a female version of James Bond. Daniel Craig is still playing 007 for now, but James Bond 25, which is set to arrive in theaters next November, is said to be his last. That means, the franchise is heading for a reboot in the next couple of years and there's been talk, mostly from fans, about having a female Bond. Theron's name has been thrown around and now she's addressed the possibility. During a recent interview, Charlize Theron was asked about playing James Bond. Nobody involved with the franchise, as far as we know, is actually looking at a female to play 007 in the future. Nor is there any indication Theron has been specifically approached, but her name has been bandied"
