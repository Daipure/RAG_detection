( Monica Akhtar / The Washington Post ) Remember back in December 2014, when Discovery Channel hyped that a man would be eaten and then regurgitated by a giant snake on a special called “ Eaten Alive? ” Then that didn ’ t actually happen, and viewers were furious? We bring this up because 57 minutes into Discovery ’ s heavily promoted Sunday night Shark Week program — in which Olympic powerhouse swimmer Michael Phelps was set to race against a great white shark — viewers heard this quote from ecologist Tristan Gutteridge, one the featured scientists : “ Clearly, we can ’ t put Michael in one lane and a white shark on the far lane."
