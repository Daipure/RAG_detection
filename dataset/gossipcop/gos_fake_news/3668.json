    "text": "Jean Shorts with Stretch Slender figure Yes, go for it! This style is great because if you don ’ t have big hips to keep your shorts up, you have the spandex / stretch element working for you. Also without wide hips you don ’ t have a lot of extra inner thigh to go around so it won ’ t look weird when it hugs you there. You can rock these and we are all jealous! Straight figure No matter what you weigh, this figure has a waist bust and hip measurement that are all pretty similar and this style of jean shorts would work really well for your figure. Like the slender body style, the stretch will keep your shorts in place! Pear / Hourglass or “ Small Waist with a Big ‘ Ol Booty ” Pear / Hour"
