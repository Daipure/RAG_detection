    "text": "Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds continue to win our hearts again and again with every public appearance they bless us with. The pair stepped out on May 14 to celebrate the premiere of Ryan's film Deadpool 2, and they only had eyes for each other. While we're used to chuckling on our own over Blake and Ryan's back - and - forth social media comments, it appears the couple spent time swapping private jokes IRL on the red carpet. Just look at Ryan whisper in her ear â€” our hearts, they melt. They were even caught in their signature couples pose ( they pinned one down before they started dating )! Keep scrolling to see more pics of the duo's night out, and feel free to reminisce on the days when they first fell in love."
