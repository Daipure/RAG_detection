    "text": "Wednesday night's Country Music Association Awards was a night of tributes. One of those tributes was for Troy Gentry, the second half of country duo, Montgomery Gentry, who was killed Sept. 8 in a helicopter crash. Eddie Montgomery joined Rascal Flatts and Dierks Bentley on stage to sing of the duo's hit songs. As the group performed, a photo montage appeared in the background. Gentry's widow was in the crowd watching, a tear streaming down her face."
