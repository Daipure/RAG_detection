    "text": "Perez Hilton has fired back at Jennifer Lawrence ‘ s Vanity Fair comments in which she took the gossip blogger to task for publishing hacked nude photos of her. “ I ’ m not trying to be Oprah. I am just a better version of me than I was 10 years ago, ” Hilton said in a video posted on his website Monday. “ Do I still have work to do? Can I still be even better? Fuck yeah, but I am not that person in the past. And if you ’ re trying to keep me in the prison that is the past, then fuck you! ” Hilton then said, “ So, actually this video is for Jennifer Lawrence, to say ‘ fuck you ’! And I ’ m going to get in trouble for that, but I don ’ t give a shit. ” See photos"
