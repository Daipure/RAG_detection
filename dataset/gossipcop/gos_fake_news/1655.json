The actress'bold style can always be counted on as a source of intrigue and excitement at events, and the Black Panther premiere was no different. What was surprising, however, was that the film's star experimented from the other side of fashion and designed a dress for her mother. Nyong'o shared the look, which has all of the hallmarks of her own style. The textile - showcasing gown was created by the actress in collaboration with Los Angeles - based African retailer Kutula. ` ` My mummy looked so pretty at the @ blackpanther premiere! @ kutula and I designed her dress."
