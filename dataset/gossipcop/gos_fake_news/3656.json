    "text": "Harry Styles knows that you care way more than you should about his relationship with ex - girlfriend Taylor Swift, and he's ready to play with your feelings a little more. Onstage at one of his concerts the other night, Styles mentioned Swift in such a sly way, that fans are already praying for a reunion. Wishing an audience member happy birthday, Styles asked how old she was turning, to which the fan replied, ` ` 22.'' It's not hard to guess what happened next. Announcing the news to the audience, Styles said, ` ` 22. She ’ s 22, okay? I don ’ t know about...'' And as every Swift fan knows, that's exactly how the lyrics to ` ` 22'' go. You can watch the whole interaction on Twitter"
