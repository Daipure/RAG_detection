Often topped with extravagant jewels and new found tans, the fabulous looks from the Riviera red carpet never fail to impress. So far, the dress of the festival must go to Elle Fanning's Vivienne Westwood showstopper, though thats not to say Naomie Harris'Gucci tulle and Charlotte Gainsbourg's Saint Laurent mini didn't give her a run for her money."
