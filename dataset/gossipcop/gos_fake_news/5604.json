    "text": "Doria Ragland was the only member of Meghan Markle's side of the family to attend the royal wedding, but the mother of the bride did not mind sitting alone as she watched her daughter marry Prince Harry. Ragland, who wore a stunning pastel green Oscar de la Renta dress and coat ( designed by creative directors Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia ), took her seat in the second row of one of the side pews inside St. George's Chapel, where Markle and Harry's wedding took place Saturday. Her seat was reportedly right across from Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, who sat beside her husband, Prince Philip. Love that the Queen and Doria Ragland are in the same colour. And they â€™ ll be sitting in the same positions on opposite sides of the aisle"
