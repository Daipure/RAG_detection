USA TODAY All Nippon Airways ( ANA ) has apologized to the passengers, which included Chrissy Teigen and husband John Legend, who took an eight - hour flight to nowhere Tuesday. Teigen live - tweeted her experience of taking off from LAX bound for Tokyo with Legend, only to have the plane make an abrupt U - turn after four hours. Flight 175 then returned to LAX after eight hours and 20 minutes of flight. Honestly everyone on the ground and in the air were very kind and apologetic. But I just need to know why we couldn â€™ t have flown to tokyo"
