    "text": "In one of the stranger moments at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards, Lorde graced us with a performance that consisted of her making faces and bopping around like a dizzy 2 - year - old. Granted, Lorde is already one of the music industry ’ s more unique performers, with a spastic style of dance that frequently looks like the marriage between a dark magician and a seizure, but the logic behind this silent, expressive performance was almost certainly not 100 percent artistic. During Sunday ’ s VMAs ceremony, Lorde had the flu. In a tweet earlier in the day, she said she was suffering from an illness and needed medical treatment : you can't tell in these pictures but i have the flu so bad i needed an IV # showgoeson # cutelilproppedupcorpse"
