That was exactly the setting in which I met her at the opening of the new TMPL gym location. Morgan, dressed in head - to - toe sequins, was the center of attention, people hanging on her every word. Luckily, I was able to steal her away for a few minutes to talk her holiday favorites, the new season of RHONY, and which co - star would get coal from her this year. Finish this sentence for us : For Sonja, it ’ s not the holidays without … Without real cranberry sauce. Right? And also Sonja Morgan designs! Are you excited"
