    "text": "This summer, it's Mandy Moore's turn to fight a shark. In 47 Meters Down ( out June 16 ), the onetime ` ` Candy'' singer stars alongside Vampire Diaries actress Claire Holt as two sisters whose vacation takes a turn for the worst when their diving cage breaks away from a boat and sinks to the bottom of the ocean. To get to safety, the sisters will have to swim through waters infested by bloodthirsty great white sharks. Guess how far that swim is? Anyway, here's something strange : I own a copy of this movie on DVD, except it's titled In the Deep. That's because 47 Meters Down was initially set to be released straight - to - DVD last August, just a little over a month after the summer's other shark attack"
