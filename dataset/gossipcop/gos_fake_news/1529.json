Though the cause of death is still unknown, People reports that it is not believed to be related to storm chasing. Fellow storm chasers and acquaintances are posting painful remembrances of the friend they lost so unexpectedly. RIP my best friend and storm chasing partner, Joel Taylor. I am shocked and absolutely devastated by the loss of my incredible, caring friend. We chased so many intense storms, and I wish we could have just one more storm chase. I'll miss you forever, Joel.
