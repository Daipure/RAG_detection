    "text": "THE DEUCE ( HBO, Sept. 9 ) David Simon and George Pelecanos ’ s Times Square time capsule jumps ahead to the disco era — more hair, worse clothes, better music and references to Al Goldstein, Spencer Haywood and Tony Manero in the first five minutes. James Franco still plays two parts and Maggie Gyllenhaal still steals the show. KIDDING ( Showtime, Sept. 9 ) Mr. Carrey plays his latest man on the moon : Jeff, a bereaved dad and children ’ s TV star known as Mr. Pickles ( no relation to the Adult Swim cartoon about a Satanic dog ), who ’ s sitting on vast reserves of anger. It ’ s Mr. Carrey ’ s first regular TV gig since “ In Living Color ” 24 years"
