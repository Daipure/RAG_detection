One of the alleged victims of Kelly ’ s rumored sex cult is speaking out, saying that the disturbing claims against the music legend are totally untrue. Jocelyn Savage, 21, whose family accused R. Kelly of holding their daughter hostage, says that she ’ s perfectly happy and safe — although she won ’ t reveal her whereabouts. She told TMZ, “ I ’ m 21, I ’ m about to be 22 in a few days and I just mainly want to say that I am in a happy place with my life and I ’ m not being brainwashed or anything like that. It just came to a point where it definitely has got out of hand"
