The former athlete has sported a lighter skin tone for years, but his most recent picture further confused netizens : Not only was Sosa ’ s skin lighter, he was wearing a red cowboy hat and a country Western shirt. Barstool Sports podcast host Dan Katz was a fan of “ cowboy Sammy. ” “ The craziest part about the Cowboy Sammy picture is that I just assumed it was an old picture because the ‘ weird Sammy Sosa picture ’ catalogue has gotten so big nothing new shocks me, ” he tweeted.
