    "text": "Alexis Bledel. Spoilers ahead for Hulu ’ s The Handmaid ’ s Tale. A few minutes into her first scene in The Handmaid ’ s Tale, Alexis Bledel holds an orange. It ’ s a relatively insignificant moment, but it struck me, since, in her years of playing Rory Gilmore on Gilmore Girls, Bledel always seemed visibly uncomfortable with props. This hit a flash point when, in the awkwardly Photoshopped posters for Netflix ’ s Gilmore revival, it appeared that she had no idea how to hold everyday objects ( I snidely tweeted about this, and Bledel later defended herself on national television ). Bledel ’ s an easy target. She never quite shed her Rory persona, nor the sense you got in Gilmore Girls"
