    "text": "7 Cult ( Season 7 ) AHS : Cult was a response to the 2016 presidential election ; it hit a little too close to home, a little too soon after everything went down. Sarah Paulson going head to head with Evan Peters was top - notch acting, but tough to take in sometimes. The season explored the dangers of extremism on both sides of the fence and didn ’ t try to mince that message at all. It felt a little preachy at times — although those clowns were creepy as hell.
