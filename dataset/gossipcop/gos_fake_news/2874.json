    "text": "A rapper who was arrested after his Arkansas concert in May has pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct, the Northwest Arkansas Democrat - Gazette reported. Misdemeanor charges of inciting a riot and endangering the welfare of a minor were dismissed against Travis Scott as part of the plea deal, his attorneys told the newspaper. Scott's real name is Jacques Webster. Doug Norwood of Rogers, who represented Scott, said the case was resolved last month. ` ` They overcharged him,'' Norwood told the Northwest Arkansas Democrat - Gazette. ` ` They tried to get him for inciting a riot. The video did not show any of that.'' After the concert, the Rogers Police Department wrote on Facebook that Webster ` ` encouraged people to rush the stage'' during his show at the Walmart Arkansas Music Pavilion"
