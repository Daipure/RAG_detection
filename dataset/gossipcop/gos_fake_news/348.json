    "text": "Beyonce attended Rihanna ’ s charity Diamond Ball event Thursday with husband Jay - Z, marking the first time the singer has made a red carpet appearance since giving birth to twins Rumi and Sir. She was decked out in a plunging emerald silk gown with a thigh - high slit – and true to her style, the singer ’ s sleeves featured some bling. Her long, blond locks were worn wavy and flowing. Rapper Jay - Z appeared at her side in black - tie with a suit and bow tie. The couple ’ s twins were born almost 13 weeks ago, and their daughter Blue Ivy is five years old.
