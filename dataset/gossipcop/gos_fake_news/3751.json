The Pearl Jam frontman stripped back the 1999 single to a soft croon, strummed electric guitar and swirling keyboard strings. “ I got a room at the top of the world tonight / I can see everything tonight, ” he sang in his trademark quivering tone. “ I got a room where everyone / Can have a drink and forget those things that went wrong in their life. ” As always, the “ In Memoriam ” segment paid tribute to Hollywood giants who died in the past year – including Harry Dean Stanton, Jonathan Demme, John Heard, Martin Landau, Glenne Headly, Roger Moore, Sam Shepard,"
