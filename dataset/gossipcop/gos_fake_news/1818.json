But for Whoopi Goldberg, her front - row must - haves include some amazing zebra Crocs and a glass of wine. Does it get any better than that? Goldberg attended the Jason Wu show during the second day of New York Fashion Week, sitting next to Amy Fine Collins, Doutzen Kroes, Zosia Mamet, and Virginia Gardner.
