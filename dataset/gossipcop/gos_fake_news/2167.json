    "text": "Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez had met only once before — 12 years earlier at a Mets - Yankees subway series game after her ex - husband Marc Anthony threw out the first pitch. But J. Lo felt compelled to approach the former baseball star last winter in Beverly Hills after she finished lunch ( tortilla soup ). She tells Vanity Fair that she could have easily walked away, but instead she tapped him on the shoulder and the rest is history. ` ` It was last winter as she was having lunch in Beverly Hills that she saw Rodriguez walk by.'I almost yelled out ‘ Alex, ’ but I am the shyest person when it comes to things like that,'''says the mag. ` ` When she went outside, he was still there, facing away from her.'I could literally just have walked away"
