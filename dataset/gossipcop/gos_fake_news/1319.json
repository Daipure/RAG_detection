He saw success with ` ` Love Never Felt So Good'' on the posthumous Michael Jackson album ` ` Xscape'' in 2014. There was also his happy - go - lucky No. 1 single ` ` Can't Stop The Feeling'' from the ` ` Trolls'' motion picture soundtrack in 2016. He also dabbled in voice acting, donning the role of lead character Branch in the animated film."
