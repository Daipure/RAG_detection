    "text": "Chris Pine and Annabelle Wallis were first spotted together in March travelling together over a holiday weekend. At the time, it wasn ’ t enough for a relationship confirmation but it was enough for Lainey ’ s smutty tingles to go off. Then, I declared them boyfriend and girlfriend after they attended a dinner party together in Malibu looking very much like they were going steady. Now, Chris and Anabelle are at the stage in their relationship where they hold hands in public and wear matching outfits. I ’ m not mad at this. Why aren ’ t I mad at this? It ’ s possible I ’ m not gagging over the intentionally coordinating ensembles because of my bias towards The Best Chris and his BDE but it may also be because they are coordinating very well.
