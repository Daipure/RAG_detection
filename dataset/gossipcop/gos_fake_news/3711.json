    "text": "When you get the chance to make a Star Wars film and have been a fan of the saga your whole life, it's hard to pass up an opportunity to appear on screen. The Last Jedi writer / director Rian Johnson might not have appeared in his film in an immediately recognizable capacity, but confirmed on the film's commentary track that he grasps Han Solo's golden dice from the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon in a close - up shot. After clashing with Rey on Ahch - To, Luke Skywalker boards the Falcon in an emotional scene, reflecting on his former ally Han Solo having been killed by Kylo Ren. Upon discovering the dice, Luke takes them from where they hung on the ship and pockets them, ultimately handing them over to his sister Leia in the film's final act."
