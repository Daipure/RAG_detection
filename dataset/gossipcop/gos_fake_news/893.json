    "text": "Photo by Ellen von Unwerth Let me just start by saying that I don't like Nicki Minaj - - I love Nicki Minaj. I have always loved her music, her vibe and her approach … she's in your fucking face. She was a star from the first moment she gave us the one - two punch of her verse on Kanye's “ Monster'' and her debut album, Pink Friday. She's appeared on every track that we know and love, and has collaborated with just about everyone cool. Funny fact, an image of Nicki sitting with Anna Wintour at New York Fashion Week ( a gift to me from photographer Patrick McMullan ) has been a centerpiece of my art collection in my home. Nicki has been on my mind for years"
