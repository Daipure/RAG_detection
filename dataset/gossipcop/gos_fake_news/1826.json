    "text": "In the almost - seven minute clip, Eminem and an unseen director talk about his fictional relationship with a married woman. It's a visual that begins with all the jazz surrounding romantic connection and ends with an unexpected pregnancy, which mirrors the bars to the collab. ` ` My personal life is not exactly a highlight reel,'' Eminem says at the start of the clip when he's asked what love means to him. Sheeran appears sporadically throughout the clip, but the main character of this video is the crumbling connection between Em and his fictional lover.
