    "text": "Kathleen Kamphausen | Lauren Ahn There's a high chance you own a flat iron and know that you can create waves with a straightener, but can't quite master * flawless * waves. Cue the knowledge that's about to be bestowed upon you in this post. 1. Create cool - girl bends ( rather than Victoria's Secret - worthy waves ) in your hair by feeding your hair into the straightener in an ` ` S'' formation. Start by dropping the middle of a section of hair into a flat iron to create the first bend. Then, feed the piece in between the flat iron clamps in an ` ` S'' curve formation, clamping down on the shape to create the bends. Repeat to the ends. ( Tip via Anthony Cole"
