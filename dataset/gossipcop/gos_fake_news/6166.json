    "text": "Gwyneth Paltrow spent her weekend celebrating her engagement to producer Brad Falchuk at a 400 - guest ` ` over - the - top'' party according to both Page Six and Paltrow's Instagram. And while there was some speculation that the soiree was actually a secret wedding — Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, and more A - listers showed — multiple sources confirmed to Page Six it really was just an extravagant engagement celebration. A wedding is said to be scheduled in the Hamptons later this year. GP is wearing a new ring though after the party. She showed off a ` ` BF'' gold band on her left ring finger at the Pre - Broadway Opening Engagement Of Head Over Heels in San Francisco. BF is obviously Falchuk"
