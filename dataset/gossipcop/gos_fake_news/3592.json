    "text": "Blake Shelton and Kelly Clarkson were friends long before their time together on The Voice. Over the years, Shelton and his girlfriend Gwen Stefani and Clarkson and her husband, Brandon Blackstock ( Shelton ’ s long - time manager ) have enjoyed many double date nights, and the evenings often involved alcohol. In a recent interview with Entertainment Tonight, Shelton and Clarkson shared some fun stories about the time they have spent together, and the American Idol winner revealed that she wonders why Stefani is with the country music superstar. Clarkson says that the first time she was in Stefani ’ s house, she felt like Julia Roberts in the scene from Pretty Woman where she walks into the store, and the women were like “ you don ’ t belong here. ” “ She ’ s such a style icon as well as this amazing artist, ” Clarkson continues."
