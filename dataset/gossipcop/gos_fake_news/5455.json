The 5 - foot - 7 executive squirmed in a chair that included a 4 - inch - thick pad under his behind while being blasted for hours with questions from lawmakers about his social network ’ s handling of user data. “ Mark Zuckerberg ’ s chair on Capitol Hill has a nice big extra cushion, ” tweeted The Washingtonian, which first noticed the seat booster.
