In the video for his latest single “ I ’ m Upset, ” the rapper looks to being anything but, staging an epic Degrassi reunion, the Canadian teen drama that he starred on before his music career took off. Waking up in bed with a girl at center court of the Air Canada Centre, Drake sneaks out when he receives a reminder about his high school reunion. He first meets up with Shane Kippel, who played Spinner, the best friend of Drake ’ s Jimmy Brooks. But the party and reunion truly starts after the duo arrives at Degrassi Community School. Among the Degrassi alums to soon join Drake and Kippel are Nina Dobrev, Stacey Farber, Adamo Ruggiero, Lauren Collins,"
