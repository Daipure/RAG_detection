    "text": "When Pink got in James Corden ’ s car for Carpool Karaoke, she took him to the Upside Down. Not that Upside Down — they stopped by a random parking lot to test her theory that she sings better upside - down. Pink sounded great, and, naturally, Corden got stuck. “ You sing better upside - down, that ’ s utter bullshit. You sounded incredible, but you ’ re Pink! ” Corden confirmed. Pink revealed another big theory — that it ’ s sweet when husbands tell you how their wives are doing before they mention themselves. James was real doubtful of that one."
