The Cool for the Summer hitmaker celebrated her inclusion on Time's 100 Most Influential People of 2017 list at the magazine's annual gala in New York City on Tuesday ( 25Apr17 ), and decided to mark the occasion by paying a late night visit to celebrity tattoo artist Keith'Bang Bang'McCurdy to have the back of her hand inked. She documented the creative process on her Snapchat and Instagram profiles, and showed off the finished artwork in a selfie, in which she held her left hand across her face to show off her new artwork. Fans were quick to weigh in on"
