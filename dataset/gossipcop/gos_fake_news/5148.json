The new images, taken by British photographer Matt Holyoak, show the two - month - old son of Prince William and Kate Middleton with his parents and other members of the royal family. The photos were taken at a small reception following Louis'christening. They show the Windsors posing with the little prince in a series of adorable portraits. In one of the most stunning shots, the Cambridges pose with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex for the photos, along with William and Harry's dad, Prince Charles, and his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. Matt Holyoak / Camera Press / Redux The Cambridges were also captured in a perfect family shot, which shows just how grown up Princess Charlotte and Prince George are now. Matt Holyoa"
