    "text": "ABC has no comment on what Barr says is Roseanne Conner's fate. Roseanne Barr is not happy with the way her character is being written out of The Conners, the spinoff of her eponymous comedy series airing on ABC in the fall. Whether it actually plays out on the show the way she describes remains to be seen. That Roseanne Conner will be dead on The Conners is not new information : Star John Goodman said as much in late August. The manner of her death, however, is in question. On conservative activist Brandon Straka's YouTube show Walk Away, Barr said Roseanne Conner will ` ` die of an opioid overdose.'' The character having an opioid problem was set up on Roseanne last season, as she started taking pain pills after a knee injury."
