Like the tour, the show ’ s headliners will be a revolving door of ’ 90s stars... beginning with Salt - N - Pepa, Rob Base ( of “ It Takes Two ” fame ), and All - 4 - One, who will be featured the first month. In subsequent months, other acts like Kid ‘ n Play, Mark McGrath of Sugar Ray, and Dru Hill are expected to join in. The show kicks off on October 12th. ( Las Vegas Review - Journal )"
