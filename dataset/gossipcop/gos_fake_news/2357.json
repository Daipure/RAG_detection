This has been the first job that I've gotten on the ground floor. It's the first pilot that I've tested my way onto, amazingly. The feeling with this was it was something special, absolutely, we thought this was very different and refreshing. But we shot the whole season before a single episode aired, so we didn't know. We shot the whole thing, and after we wrapped, we were a month away from the pilot airing. We heard great things from down here in L. A., from the studio from Warner Bros. and from CW that they love it, they love all"
