    "text": "8 Beverly Hills Ranch This ranch - style home reflects the mid - century modern designs of 1950's Hollywood, when it was built. Sitting at the base of lush green hills, the great location creates an airy, sunlight - filled home. Despite its modest facade, the four - bed, four - bath ranch features white beamed ceilings, floor - to - ceiling glass, and best of all : a 1000 - bottle, climate - controlled wine cellar. She listed the home in May of 2018 and it sold for $ 2. 65 million in September, $ 300, 000 less than the asking price. Still, she made a total of $ 850, 000 on the sale. Go Taylor!"
