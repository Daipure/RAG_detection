    "text": "Cape Town – Kendall Jenner's first - ever ad for Adidas is out and it ’ s a sci - fi / futuristic mix - up. The ad is the third instalment of the brand ’ s ` ` ORIGINAL is never finished'' campaign and also stars the likes of James Harden, 21 Savage, Playboi Carti and Young Thug. Set to a remix of Frank Sinatra ’ s My Way the ad certainly lives up to what it promises in the title. Each celeb featured has their own space set against a backdrop of Botticelli's Birth of Venus and DaVinci's Vitruvian Man. One of Kendall ’ s spots is in a glass box. The Victoria's Secret model can be seen lying in the box"
