    "text": "Saturday Night Live's Aidy Bryant is a Cardi B superfan. So when the ` ` Bodak Yellow'' star appeared as a musical guest on the show, Bryant felt inspired. Watching ` ` Aidy B'' take no shit from her co - workers ( even when there's no shit being given ) is delightful. But watching her fan out in front of an increasingly concerned Cardi B is a laugh riot."
