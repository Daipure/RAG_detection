    "text": "After Monday's shocking ` ` most dramatic'' ending ever to The Bachelor, one big question is swirling around Bachelor nation â€” why did everything happen the way it did? Here's what went down : Bachelor star Arie Luyendyk Jr. fell in love with both of his two finalists, Lauren Burnham and Becca Kufrin. He was conflicted until the last day of production, ultimately deciding to break up with Lauren and propose to Becca that same night. One month later, however, he couldn't stop thinking about Lauren and he brought ABC's cameras along to break it off with his clueless now - fiancee, Becca, in hopes of reconciling with Lauren. The devastating scene played out, completely unedited, during the last act of a three - hour finale."
