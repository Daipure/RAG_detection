    "text": "Part of the fun of acting is pretending to be someone else for a little while. Also fun? Making a salary that is often quite a bit higher than what your on - screen counterpart makes. The 15 highest - paid TV actresses made $ 208. 5 million in the 12 months to June, while their on - screen characters would have made about $ 2. 2 million, just 1. 1 % of the actresses â€™ total. If the end goal is big money, these actresses should stay on the small screen. Case in point : Kaley Cuoco ranks second on our list, earning $ 24. 5 million between June 1, 2015 and June 1, 2016. Her character on The Big Bang Theory, Penny, is a pharmaceutical sales representative, a career that makes an average salary of $ 68, 173, according to Glassdo"
