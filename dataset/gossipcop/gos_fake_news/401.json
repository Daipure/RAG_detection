    "text": "The star of Riverdale was involved in a late - night car crash last week after a grueling 16 - hour work day outside Vancouver, prompting the cast and crew of the hit CW show to demand better safety protections during production. K. J. Apa, 20, who plays Archie in the Warner Bros. - produced Archie Comics adaptation, apparently fell asleep driving the 45 - minute trip home after midnight. He was taken to a local hospital for observation and later discharged without serious injuries. His car, however, didn't fare as well. The passenger side was apparently destroyed after striking a light pole, and the vehicle was rendered inoperable. The crash has ignited a firestorm of protest on the Riverdale set, sources tell The Hollywood Reporter. The show routinely requires shoots that last until the early morning hours"
