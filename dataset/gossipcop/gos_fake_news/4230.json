    "text": "There were some pleasant surprises from Wednesday morning ’ s SAG Awards nominations. Emily Blunt got nominated twice in the film categories, including for “ A Quiet Place ” and “ Mary Poppins Returns, ” and John David Washington broke into the Best Actor field in a mostly white crowd for “ BlacKkKlansman. ” But Regina King, a true standout in Barry Jenkins ’ “ If Beale Street Could Talk ” and thus far a presumed front runner in the Oscar race, was snubbed from the Female Actress in a Supporting Role category, as was the movie at large. And the snub has many critics and fans scratching their heads. “ I believe in Regina King, ” actress Carrie Coon tweeted in support of the actress after King was left out of the SAG field."
