The Kardashian family has never done anything half - arsed. Whether it's selfies, massive beauty empires or sex tapes, they really do go all in. And one Kardashian commitment that we are so, so glad they have stuck to is their lavish annual Christmas card. With Christmas fast approaching, we are all ready and waiting for the family to drop this year's card. Rumours have already been circling as to who will be in it will Scott be cut out again? Will Tristan be in it? ),"
