Simpson recounted the “ hypothetical ” way he might have killed his ex - wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ron Goldman, in a controversial two - hour special on Fox Sunday night, aptly titled, O. J. Simpson : The Lost Confession? Over the course of the special, Simpson described to publisher Judith Regan, in increasing detail, the series of events that could have hypothetically led to Nicole and Goldman ’ s 1994 deaths. He made mention of a friend named “ Charlie ” who was with him at the time of the murders, though at certain points throughout the interview, he alternated between talking about Charlie and speaking in the first person. The interview was originally conducted in 2006 in supposed conjunction with the release of his book, If I Did It. Backlash"
