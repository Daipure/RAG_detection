    "text": "The women of the E! series “ Second Wives Club ” won ’ t be joining the Second Season Club because their show has been canceled. According to our sources, the women on the show were surprised by the decision. We ’ re told the cast, made up of wealthy socialites like Lorenzo Lamas ’ ex - wife, believed the show was doing well and a second season was in the cards. Sources close to the show tell us the producers aren ’ t giving up on the show just because E! did — they are hopeful Bravo might snatch it up. An E! rep couldn ’ t be reached for comment."
