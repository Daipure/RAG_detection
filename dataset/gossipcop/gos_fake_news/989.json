    "text": "A cringeworthy video of Katie Couric talking about Matt Lauer in 2012 has surfaced in the wake of NBC ’ s firing of Lauer on Wednesday for alleged sexual misconduct. Couric, who had anchored “ Today ” alongside Lauer for many years, was asked by “ Watch What Happens Live ” host Andy Cohen to identify Lauer ’ s most annoying habit. “ He pinches me on the ass a lot, ” Couric answered in the clip, posted by TMZ. “ Wow, I wouldn ’ t have a problem with that, ” Cohen quipped, and the two laughed off the exchange. Even if Couric was joking, her answer strikes a different chord when heard after all the recent sexual misconduct allegations in journalism, entertainment and politics."
