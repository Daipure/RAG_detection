    "text": "Los Angeles : Former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has lashed out at US President Donald Trump's rebuke of American intelligence agencies during a news conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump stunned the world on Monday by shying away from criticising the Russian leader for Moscow's actions to undermine the election and cast doubt on US intelligence agencies, prompting calls by some US lawmakers for tougher sanctions and other actions to punish Russia. ` ` President Trump, I just saw your press conference with President Putin and it was embarrassing,'' Schwarzenegger said in a Facebook video on Monday, unshaven and appearing distraught. ` ` I mean you stood there like a little wet noodle, like a little fanboy."
