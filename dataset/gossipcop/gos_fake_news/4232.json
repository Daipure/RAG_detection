    "text": "The Biggest Night in Latin Music took over Las Vegas on Nov. 15 for the 19th Latin GRAMMY Awards and celebrated some of its brightest rising and established stars. The evening made some artist first - time winners and gave other artists more awards to add to their collection, with many taking to social media to celebrate with fans. Several incredibly talented young artists had the excitement of taking home their first Latin GRAMMY wins, including Spain's nuevo flamenco popstar Rosal√≠a, Colombia's reigning queen of reggaeton Karol G and fellow Colombian Maluma, the sensual pop - infused reggaeton singer. Another Colombian reggaetonero, the forefather of the reemergence of the genre, J Balvin, took home his third Latin GRAMMY this year. https :"
