    "text": "Ed Sheeran won Best Pop Solo Performance for ` ` Shape Of You'' at the 60th GRAMMY Awards. This marks Sheeran's second career win in the category. The other nominees in the category were Kelly Clarkson's ` ` Love So Soft,'' Kesha's ` ` Praying,'' Lady Gaga's ` ` Million Reasons,'' and P! nk's ` ` What About Us.'' Sheeran was unable to attend the 60th GRAMMYs due to schedule conflicts, so the award was accepted on his behalf. His win for ` ` Shape Of You,'' along with his additional win for Best Pop Vocal Album for Divide, at the 60th GRAMMYs brings his career GRAMMY total"
