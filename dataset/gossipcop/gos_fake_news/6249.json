    "text": "Miley Cyrus wears whatever she wants to wear. Some times that means latex underwear. Other times that means tie - dye print or cowboy boots. This star truly uses fashion to express her artistic edge. No matter what she choses to wear, it â€™ s always epic. Since about 2006, when Hannah Montana was a Disney must - see, Miley has been in the spotlight, consistently appearing in conversation - starting outfits. Her fearless attitude towards style has stayed the same all of these years, yet what she chooses to wear is certainly different now."
