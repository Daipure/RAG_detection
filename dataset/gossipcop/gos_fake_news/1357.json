    "text": "Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has been caught on video getting kicked out of a New York City bar after a dispute around the pool table. The video, shot Friday night in Barfly, a cozy dive bar in the otherwise upscale Gramercy Park neighborhood, shows the actor who plays Jon Snow arguing with bouncers and patrons. The context of the dispute is unclear, but 31 - year - old Harington appears at points to be attempting to locate his coat and belongings in a manner disruptive to the other revelers. His leading - man charm didn't appear to impress one young lady, who tartly tells him'Say excuse me'as he tries to jostle past her. Kit Harington as Jon Snow is seen with Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targa"
