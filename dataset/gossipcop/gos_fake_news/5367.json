Mother Sil Mazzini says she shared the snap in the heat of the moment, after becoming upset that none of her son Teddy's 32 classmates had showed up to the event at Peter Piper Pizza in Tucson, Arizona on Sunday. The photo, which Mazzini shared to a local news reporter Nick VinZant, showed little Teddy looking sad as he sat on his own in front of long table filled with pizzas and dozens of empty paper plates. She added that she deeply regretted ever sharing the post, which quickly went viral with more than 2, 000 comments and more than 1, 000 shares.'If I could go back"
