    "text": "Unsurprisingly, Amal Clooney's post - maternity style streak is still going strong. The human rights attorney and new mother showed off her latest look on Sunday when she and her husband George enjoyed the night out. The two hit up Harry's Bar at Piazza Risorgimento in Lake Como last night, TMZ reports. For the outing, Amal donned a sheer, sequined Stella McCartney floor - length dress with lace panels, while George went low - key with a button - down and jeans. MEGA Clooney's halter number was shiny enough, but she added just the right amount of jewelry without going overboard. She wore studded hoop earrings and a gold cuff on her right wrist to go along with the outfit. ME"
