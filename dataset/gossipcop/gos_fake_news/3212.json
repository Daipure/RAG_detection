The couple, who met and got engaged on season 17 of The Bachelor before tying the knot in January 2014, took to social media to share sweet pics and messages on their baby boy's big day. ` ` Happy birthday Samuel!'' Sean captioned a smiley pic of his son decked out in Minions gear. ` ` You don't have Instagram so you won't see this, and even if you did you can't read, but this is what parents do to show their love I guess. Here's to you playing with the plastic bags instead of toys today!'' Happy birthday Samuel! You don't have Instagram so"
