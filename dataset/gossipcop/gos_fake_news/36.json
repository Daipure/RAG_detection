    "text": "Listen, there are lots of dog shows out there and we love them all : The National Dog Show, the Westminster Dog Show, pretty much every episode of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. But there is only one that combines both the competition and the glamour of all of the above, and that ’ s the Beverly Hills Dog Show ( presented by Purina ). Airing this Sunday at 8 PM on USA, the dog show takes a more entertaining approach than its staid counterparts. While it does feature trophies, it also highlights over 1, 000 dogs parading down a puppy red carpet — and Lisa Vanderpump will be presenting the Best in Show award! Watch a sneak peek above!"
