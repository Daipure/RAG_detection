    "text": "Major spoilers for “ Game of Thrones ” up to Season 7 Episode 3 ahead. “ Game of Thrones ” is moving a bit fast, right? Jon Snow arrives at Dragonstone from Winterfell in less than an episode, for instance, while Euron Greyjoy goes from King ’ s Landing to somewhere between Dragonstone and Sandstone, back to King ’ s Landing and then to Casterly Rock in three episodes. In the past, such moves would ’ ve taken all season, thanks to traveling on horseback or by boat. Nowadays, it ’ s like the characters invented the Hyperloop off - screen, which would ’ ve helped Daenerys instead of waiting six seasons to get her to Westeros. This new breakneck speed has characters teleporting all over the Westerosi map"
