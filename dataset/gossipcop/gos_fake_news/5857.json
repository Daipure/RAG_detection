The pair banter about books flirtatiously, and it ’ s clear that there ’ s an instant attraction, a * spark * if you will. The woman reaches up to grab a book off the top shelf, and the man scans her up and down. “ If this was a movie, I ’ d grab you and we ’ d go at it right in the stacks, ” he says in a voiceover, invoking visions of spontaneous passion that should be familiar to anyone who ’ s spent time watching romance films. But it isn ’ t a movie. And it ’ s not quite a romance, either"
