She didn ’ t go to court on Friday, May 25, but agreed to the plea than five months after the embarrassing incident in which The Real Housewives of New York star, 53, was arrested and charged with felonies – resisting an officer with violence, disorderly intoxication and battery on a law enforcement officer. Yesterday, according to the Daily Mail, it was determined that de Lesseps will have those serious charges dropped in exchange for a plea of guilty to a lesser misdemeanor. The reality TV star is due back in court for a plea conference in July, where the charges will be reduced. PHOTOS : ‘ RHONY ’ Star Luann De Less"
