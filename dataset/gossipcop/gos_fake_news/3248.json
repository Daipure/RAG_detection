    "text": "Spoiler alert : Spider - Man : Homecoming ’ s two credits scenes are discussed in full below. There are two credits scenes at the end of Spider - Man : Homecoming. One might figure into future Marvel films, while the other is nothing more than a playful — but worthwhile — joke. Mid - and post - credits scenes have become a Marvel tradition, something fans look forward to every time the company releases a new film. Sometimes they contain huge reveals that hint at future movies ( see : Black Panther at the end of Captain America : Civil War ). Other times, they serve as little winks from Marvel to its biggest fans, and call back to the company's history ( see : Howard the Duck at the end of the first Guardians of the Galaxy ). They're fun. They can be exciting."
