The 29 - year - old mother of King Cairo and Dream Kardashian — her children with Tyga and Rob Kardashian, respectively — was seen allegedly getting into an argument at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, Calif. In videos shared on social media, Chyna is seen grabbing a pink stroller and swinging it around wildly. Neither child is seen in the footage, posted by Twitter user AliciaaAngiee.
