When asked by Morgan if there will ever be more Sex and the City, Cattral said, “ Not for me. That was part of turning 60. That was a very clear moment of how many years do I have left and what do I want to do with it? What haven ’ t I done? I feel that the show was the best when it was the series and the bonus was the two movies. ”"
