    "text": "Instagram quickly outgrew its first impression as a fun app for kids and has become a serious content marketing, selling, networking and audience building tool for individuals and brands. It's one of the most popular social networking sites on the planet, with over 200 million active monthly members sharing 60 million images and 1. 6 billion likes per day. Just how awesome is it? Engagement rates for brands on most social networks are less than 0. 1 %, but Instagram blows them all away. The average Instagram engagement rate for brands in a 2014 Forrester study was an epic 58 times higher than on Facebook. You can't argue with numbers like that. But that's just average. And as I advocate across all manners of online marketing, you don't want to be average!"
