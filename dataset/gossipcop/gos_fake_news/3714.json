    "text": "UPDATE : Contrary to an earlier report from TMZ, we haven ’ t seen the last of MTV ’ s TRL revival. Quite the opposite, apparently. A rep for the show tells TVLine that “ TRL has been a huge success for us and we ’ re expanding the franchise with daily late night and morning shows this summer. ” The afternoon program — which began as a countdown of the day ’ s most popular music videos, though that concept got lost somewhere along the way — was revived in Oct. 2017 to much critical ire. ( TVLine called it “ a mess. ” ) Now, it seems some major changes are in store. Your thoughts on TRL? Drop ’ em in a comment below."
