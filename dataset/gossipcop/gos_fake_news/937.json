AdGage reports that Gatorade hired a stunt double for the baby because she got sick. A Gatorade spokesperson e - mailed AdGage saying : While Serena intended to have Olympia make her screen debut as part of this film, her daughter was under the weather and unable to be on set, but the sentiment remains the same. Although fans may be disappointed to learn that it wasn ’ t actually Serena ’ s daughter, the ad has an inspirational message. In the video above, the tennis star shares all the lessons she learned from sports, including strengths and goals."
