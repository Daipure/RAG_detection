    "text": "Khloé Kardashian finally confirmed her pregnancy in December after two months of rumors, which was a relief for those of us who pay attention to the Kardashian's every move. Now, we can stop looking for clues about Khloé's pregnancy and start looking for clues about Kylie Jenner's pregnancy, which is as of yet unconfirmed. Luckily, we have Ellen Degeneres, who grilled her on Kylie's rumored pregnancy during Khloé's first post - announcement talk show appearance."
