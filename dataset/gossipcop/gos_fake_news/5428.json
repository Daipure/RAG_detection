    "text": "( CNN ) A grand jury indicted actress and activist Rose McGowan Monday on one felony count of cocaine possession, according to Loudoun County, Virginia court documents. McGowan voluntarily surrendered to authorities in Virginia in November in response to an arrest warrant. She later pleaded not guilty to the charge. The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority obtained the warrant in February last year after authorities allegedly found traces of narcotics in her personal belongings that were left behind on a United flight in January to Washington, D. C. McGowan tweeted about incident, asking, ` ` Are they trying to silence me?'' ` ` There is a warrant out for my arrest in Virginia,'' she wrote. ` ` What a load of HORSES * * T.''"
