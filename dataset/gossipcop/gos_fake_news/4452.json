Even though Kate Middleton isn't traveling with him, the Duchess is clearly on William's mind. Today, the Duke visited Jerash, an archaeological site and one of Jordan's most popular tourists spots. While touring the site, William stopped to pay tribute to Kate by recreating a sweet childhood photo taken when the Duchess was four years old. William posed at the same exact spot seen here in this Middleton family photo : In the Middleton family photo taken at the historic site, a young Kate smiles with Michael Middleton and her sister, Pippa. The Middletons lived in Amman, Jordan in May 1984 through September 1986 after relocating due to Michael's job with British Airways."
