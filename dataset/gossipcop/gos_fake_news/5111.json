    "text": "LeeAnne Locken, a gift that keeps on giving, is back for The Real Housewives of Dallas season three. And, this should come as no surprise, she ’ s serving the drama up real good. LeeAnne, who returns alongside everyone from season two : Cary Deuber, Stephanie Hollman, Brandi Redmond, D ’ Andra Simmons and Kameron Westcott, wastes no time giving viewers the best moment in the season three trailer ( above ). “ I ’ m exhausted! My weave is exhausted ; the panty - liner on my underwear is exhausted, ” LeeAnne says to an unseen person. Bless her. But that ’ s not the only dramatic moment. No, the ladies from the Lone Star state are serving."
