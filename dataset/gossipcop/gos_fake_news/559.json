But even if most of the show's love affairs end in bloodshed, they come packed with passion and loads of lore, fueled by longing for the past and fueling vengeance in the future. With few exceptions, the following love stories were all doomed from the start â€” but their heat resulted in sonnets of long ago, and legends in the making."
