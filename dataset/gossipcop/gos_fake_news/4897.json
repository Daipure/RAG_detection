Hadid was said to be in the crowd during the set, and according to E! and Us Weekly, ended up spending time with him at the festival this weekend, kissing and being cuddly and coupley just like old times. But don't get it twisted â€” they're just ` ` secretly seeing each other'' but not exclusively. The Weeknd also got PDAy with one of Justin Bieber's ex - girlfriends the next day. Hadid and The Weeknd reportedly were seen ` ` kissing all night'' at the Kylie Cosmetics Coach"
