The ` ` El Señor de los Cielos'' star had posted on Twitter she was looking for her cousin and her husband following the temblor. ` ` If anyone has info of Florencia Lorandi Castillo or Martín Velez Tenorio that were in Edimburgo street, their families are looking for them'', she plead. Castillo then took to Instagram to echo her plea writing : ` ` Please, any information you may have, they were in the Edimburgo building and we can't contact them.'' Hours later it was Fernanda's brother, Pablo, that confirmed they had been found dead. ` ` It hurts my soul,''"
