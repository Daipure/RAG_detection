    "text": "July 2 : Kylie Is Back To Posting Pics of Stormi Remember that time a fan gave Kylie crap for cutting Stormi out of a selfie? Kylie replied to that commenter : ` ` Yeah, I cut my baby out. I'm not sharing photos of my girl right now.'' Well, it looks like the no - Stormi - on - social - media embargo has just been lifted as Kylie posts a cute AF pic of her cuddling with her baby. The pic has the text ` ` nothing better'' written across it. In the photo, little Stormi sleeps in a white tee on Kylie's chest. In the pic, you can also catch a glimpse of Kylie's tiny ` ` S'' necklace ( for Stormi, of course )"
