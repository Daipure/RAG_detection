For those of you who know the movie, I ’ m sure that you have the same question that most of us were left with … “ What happened after that final night at Kellerman ’ s? Did Baby and Johnny stay together or did they go their own separate ways? ” While it could have gone either way, I think the majority of us wanted to believe that Baby and Johnny did continue on after that and ended up happily wed with babes"
