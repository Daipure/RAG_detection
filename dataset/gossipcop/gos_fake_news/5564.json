    "text": "Cardi B has a message for the Barbz. Following the leak of Cardi's new song ` ` Money'' on Tuesday, the artist went on Instagram Live to address Nicki Minaj's fans. In Cardi's brief IG Live video, she explained that her newest song was leaked two days early, much to her dismay. Cardi then alludes to the Barbz being the reason why she and her team decided to go ahead with the release in advance of it's planned date. ` ` We tried to retract it, but you know the Barbz. They always posting me, they always post everything I do,'' she said. ` ` They claim they hate me, but they really love me, because they be on my page before my fans."
