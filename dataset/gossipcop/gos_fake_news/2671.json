    "text": "In a sneak peek of Wednesday night's ` ` Hollywood Medium,'' Tyler Henry describes feeling an energy circulating around tragedy during his reading with Nancy Grace. ` ` There's a feeling of a situation getting out of hand and not going how it was intended to originally go,'' Tyler tells Grace. ` ` This doesn't look like,'I was supposed to die that day.'The feeling is I don't even necessarily get the strongest impression of someone seeking someone out, like,'I'm going to take your life.'There's a feeling of something goes wrong, and I don't know why this feeling of something goes wrong, like that wasn't the original plan.'' The medium adds that the feeling comes across more as a robbery than it does"
