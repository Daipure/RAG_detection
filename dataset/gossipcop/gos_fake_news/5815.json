    "text": "Scream helped to revive the horror genre back in the'90s, and now enthusiasts can return to the house where all the madness took place. Dubbed ` ` Scream Comes Home,'' the Kickstarter campaign is the product of fans Anthony Masi and Nate Ragon, who managed to convince the home's owners to have a party in there. It's been described as a ` ` once - in - a - lifetime SCREAM gathering and screening of the iconic horror movie at the actual house where its classic ending took place.'' Taking place the weekend before Halloween, the party will go down in the Tomales, California house used to film the horror's final scene. Of course, you'll have to fork out for the opportunity. Prices range from the sold - out $ 1, 250 overnight"
