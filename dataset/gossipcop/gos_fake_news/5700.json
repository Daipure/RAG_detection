    "text": "The view from the top of Koko Head Trail is surely worth the journey. This is one of my favorite places in the world. Today the wind came from the same direction as Maui in the distance. As it touched my face I was moved thinking not along ago I too left the shores of Maui on the journey that led me here. I didn ’ t cry a little bit. Not at all. I ’ ve never cried. Not even as a baby. Weird. # crossfit A post shared by chris pratt ( @ prattprattpratt ) on Jun 10, 2018 at 12 : 59pm PDT"
