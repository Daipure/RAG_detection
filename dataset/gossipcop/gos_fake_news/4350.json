    "text": "Piers Morgan today called Meghan Markle's estranged half - sister a'little vulture'and accused her of grabbing money by'trashing'the Suits star. Samantha Markle appeared on Good Morning Britain and was accused of'trading off her very tenuous connection'with Meghan, who she hasn't seen for ten years. In an explosive exchange Mr Morgan asked her :'How much money have you made from trashing Meghan Markle?'to which Samantha replied :'Not very much '. Ms Markle said she had encouraged her father to do a deal with paparazzi claiming he had been treated'shabbily'by the media. But Piers went on the offensive and said :'There's no bigger media vulture in this wedding than you."
