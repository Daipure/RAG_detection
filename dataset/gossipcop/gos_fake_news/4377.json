    "text": "1 SHARES Facebook Twitter A few months ago, we received a teaser trailer for the upcoming Christopher Robin film. It didn ’ t show a lot of the premise of the film, but what it did show was Winnie the Pooh in live action setting. While there were people the criticised how Pooh looked, the overall thoughts were positive. Having a film that has Pooh search out an older Christopher Robin seems like the exact film we need. Then came the release of a new trailer today, and I can say it hit every emotion it needed. Christopher Robin is a film that will show an older Christopher Robin, but showing a person who ’ s forgotten about his past. Winnie the Pooh and friends seem to never forgetting about him, which makes the trailer seem so much more tragic. Anyone who watched cartoons or films"
