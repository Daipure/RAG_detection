The Real Housewives of Orange County reunion part II is full of surprises … Andy Cohen begins round II, I mean part II, by addressing the black cloud that lingered over Shannon the whole season. We find out that Shannon ’ s maiden name is actually “ STORM, ” so it ’ s all starting to make sense why she was such an emotional curmudgeon this season. Oh and because her ex - husband is a total troll. Shannon ’ s flashbacks are uncomfortable and we are all reminded of the infamous “ Quiet Woman ” event, which in Housewives history, is, in my opinion, a close second to Teresa ’ s table flip. Finally, “ that one, ” aka Peggy, speaks out."
