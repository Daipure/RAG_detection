    "text": "For a while now, Will and Jada have said that they don ’ t call themselves married anymore. Instead, they call themselves life partners. Personally, I wondered about that. What was that about? What ’ s the reason. But in an interview with People, Jada explained. “ I needed a different form to dissolve all the expectations that I had of a marriage. I needed to do that to see Will outside of husband and see him as a human being. We have all these expectations. ‘ Oh, this is what a husband is. This is what a wife is. ’ I started dissolving all the ideas and expectations and labels. ” Will will join Jada, her mother Adrienne Banefield - Jones and daughter Willow Smith on the season premiere of “ Red Table Talk ” on Facebook on October"
