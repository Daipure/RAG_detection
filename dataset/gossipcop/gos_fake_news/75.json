    "text": "Reality star Whitney Port has used her YouTube channel to provide an honest take on what she's experienced as a first - time mother. Her most recent video posted last week, titled'I love my baby, but I wish my body didn't have to change ', described how her body was altered physically both during and after the pregnancy. The 32 - year - old gained 40lbs while pregnant with her son, Sonny Sanford, and said her body hasn't bounced back like she hoped. Port had a vaginal delivery in July, which can cause pain and discomfort to that area for weeks after. But that hasn't been her only physical change. Daily Mail Online breaks down other changes new mothers such as Port experience when giving birth including skin discoloration, hair loss and breast enlargement."
