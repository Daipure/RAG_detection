    "text": "Jay - Z said Kanye West's rant against him last year hurt him because he brought Beyoncé into it. The rapper made his comments on the Rap Radar podcast on his streaming service TIDAL on Thursday, marking his first remarks about West's rant and his first interview since the June 30 release of his album ` ` 4 : 44.'' Last November, West unleashed an onstage rant about Jay - Z, with whom he has collaborated in the past, and Beyoncé at a concert, pleading with Jay - Z to call him and accusing Beyoncé of refusing to perform at this 2016 MTV Video Music Awards unless her ` ` Formation'' video won Video of the Year, which it did. West then canceled the remainder of his Saint Pablo tour and then checked himself into a hospital to treat exhaustion. ` `"
