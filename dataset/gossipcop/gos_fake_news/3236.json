    "text": "Angela Lansbury will star alongside Michael Gambon and Emily Watson in a new adaptation of the classic novel by Louisa May Alcott. The three - part adaptation is written by Call the Midwife's Heidi Thomas, who also wrote the screenplay for Cranford and the 2010 revival Upstairs Downstairs, and will air on BBC One. Lansbury, feted on stage and adored in film and on television, most notably for her mystery writer and amateur detective Jessica Fletcher in Murder She Wrote, will play the cantankerous Aunt March. Emily Watson ( Apple Tree Yard, The Theory of Everything ) will take on the role of Marmee, the matriarch of the March family, while Michael Gambon ( Harry Potter ) will play neighbour Mr Laurence."
