Renner showed off his injuries at a press conference at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival in the Czech Republic on Friday, saying that he fractured his left wrist and his right elbow. Despite reports to the contrary, the injury happened not during Infinity War but during filming for the upcoming comedy Tag. Still, Renner says, he doesn ’ t expect his broken arms to affect filming on the upcoming superhero sequel. “ It won ’ t stop things that I need to do, ” Renner told reporters at the film festival, via The Hollywood Reporter. “ I heal fast and am doing everything I can to heal faster. ” “ I shall heal up before Avengers starts up again, ” he added."
