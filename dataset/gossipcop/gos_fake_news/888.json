As you may already know, the former star of the Spice Girls filed a domestic violence suit against the producer amidst their troublesome divorce. During the legal battle, the court granted Mel B a restraining order against her ex which involved her three daughters including Madison, whom Belafonte was given monitored visitation rights. First night out with my amazing daughter in 8 months and I felt like god gave us beautiful sunset to share!! Maddy loved the red to yellow to sunset color!!!! # blessed A post shared by Stephen Belafonte ( @ stephenthinks11 ) on Nov 14, 2017 at"
