Jennifer Lawrence came a close section, looking dark and moody in Schiaparelli Couture, while Julianne Moore's dark red tresses looked beautiful against an emerald green Chanel couture gown. And we have to give special mention to Jada Pinkett Smith, who went braless in a sheer, shimmering gown, which we consider the prettiest naked dress ever.
