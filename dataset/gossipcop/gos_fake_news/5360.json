    "text": "4. So who actually pulled the trigger on Tupac? Karding claims that Tupac was killed by Crips gang member Orlando ` ` Baby Lane'' Anderson. He alleges that the original hit was supposed to be carried out by ` ` Keffe D'' but plans were changed at the last minute after they unexpectedly pulled up on the wrong side of Tupac's vehicle.

Interestingly, Baby Lane also got into a fist fight with Pac at a Vegas casino hours before the shooting took place."
