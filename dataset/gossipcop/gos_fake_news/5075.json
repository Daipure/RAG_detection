So, during an appearance on Bravo ’ s Watch What Happens Live on Monday night, host Andy Cohen grilled Shep about his ‘ sexy times ’ with Kathryn. Shep also dropped a shocker when he revealed that at one point, Craig Conover was actually trying to date Kathryn, plus he shared that Ashley Jacob ’ s behavior was actually worse than what was shown on the show. If you recall, Kathryn, 24, and Shep, 38, had a one night stand during season one of Southern Charm before Kathryn started dating Thomas Ravenel. Many fans of the show had thought it was a one and done deal"
