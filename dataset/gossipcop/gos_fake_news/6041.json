    "text": "Kylie Jenner was spotted out and about with two giant, sparkly diamond rings on her ring finger and everyone's all, ` ` ooooooh she's engaged to Travis Scott!'' BUT IS SHE?? First, let's look at the evidence â€” which is just this picture that the paps snapped while Kylie was out and about with bestie Jordyn Woods on Saturday afternoon. BACKGRID Kylie also shared some video of the rings : And uh... that's all the evidence we have. Back in early March, Kylie sparked rumors that she was engaged when she wore a band on her ring finger, but that turned out just to be a ring. OR WAS IT?! What's more, Kylie appears to have worn these exact diamond rings before"
