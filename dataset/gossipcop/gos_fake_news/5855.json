Read More I've never liked liquid foundation because it was so hard for me to get it all even. I received a sample of this foundation and not only did it match my skin tone, but it went on without any trouble. The finished result was an amazing natural look that still covered up my flaws. It's extremely lightweight compared to what I'm used to using to be able to cover my freckles and redness. I've had many comments about how much better my makeup looks. Growing up I started using Max Factor Pan Stick."
