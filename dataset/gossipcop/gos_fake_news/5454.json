Fan favorite Colton Haynes — who just last month reprised his role as Roy Harper, to usher former leading lady Willa Holland off the canvas — is set to return to the superhero drama as a series regular for Season 7. “ We ’ re very fortunate and excited to welcome back Colton to Arrow, ” the show ’ s executive producers said in a statement. “ While we ’ ve always enjoyed Colton ’ s returns to the show, we couldn ’ t be more thrilled to have him return as a proper series regular — and we ’ re very excited about all the creative opportunities Roy Harper ’ s return affords us. ” Haynes in turn said, “ I could not be happier to return to my role as Roy Harper alongside my Arrow family. ”"
