    "text": "Update From Editor Peter Sciretta : The following post was published on February 7th 2013 after we first learned that Disney was developing a Star Wars spin - off standalone film that would follow a young Han Solo, set between Episode III : Revenge of the Sith and Episode IV : A New Hope. Now that it has been confirmed that a Star Wars Anthology film following a young Han Solo will be directed by Lego Movie directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller for a Summer 2018 release, I thought this might be worth republishing. What would a Han Solo standalone original movie be about? Sifting through the backstory established in the original trilogy, the elaborate expanded universe in the books and games, witht he help of Wookieepedia, we have some good ideas of what we might expect from this stand"
