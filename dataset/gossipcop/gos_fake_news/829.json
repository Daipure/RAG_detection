The television star has denied the claim, saying that he does not know the accuser. Cohen — who posted the claim on Facebook with details of her emotional state over the past month during the flood of sexual misconduct stories in Hollywood ( she called the outpouring ` ` both triggering and emotionally exhausting'' ) — alleges that Westwick sexually assaulted her three years ago, in February 2014, during ` ` a dark time in my life.'' Her mother was sick with cancer ( she died three months after the alleged assault ) and she did not have the support system to deal with ` ` the aftermath of the rape.'' Reached by The Hollywood Reporter"
