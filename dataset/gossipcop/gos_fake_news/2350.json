    "text": "Tracee Ellis Ross was one of the brave few to show up on the Met Gala red carpet actually wearing one of Rei Kawakubo's Commes Des Garçons designs, becoming part of an exclusive group that included Rihanna and Caroline Kennedy. The Black - ish actress chose a sculptural blue outfit from CDG's Spring 2016 ` ` Blue Witch'' collection. While it may not have been as constricting as Helen Lasichanh's arm - encumbering red CDG outfit, the runway piece wasn't exactly designed with practicality in mind, as is the case with much Commes Des Garçons. Still, as Ross explained last night on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, she felt it was an honor to wear it"
