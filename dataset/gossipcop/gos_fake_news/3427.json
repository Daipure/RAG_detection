Gosling first described the ` ` fight scene'' punch to GQ in December. After Ford accidentally clocked Gosling in the face amid a flurry of fake punches, Gosling said that ` ` 2049'' director Denis Villeneuve told him, ` `'Look at it this way â€” you just got hit by Indiana Jones.'''Ford and Gosling have since discussed the punch on several late - night shows. Ford recounted the punch on ` ` The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon'' this week."
