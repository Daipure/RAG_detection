    "text": "Robert Wilson, legendary TV producer and father to actors Luke Wilson and Owen Wilson, died on Friday. He was 75. Luke confirmed the news to the Dallas Morning News just ahead of the weekend. He also told the Texas paper that his dad had spent the last few years battling Alzheimer ’ s disease, suggesting a cause of death. While his sons are both household names, Robert was a successful TV icon himself. Not only did he help launch Jim Lehrer ’ s career with “ Newsroom ” through local, public affiliate KERA in 1968 — Lehrer famously hosted PBS ’ “ NewsHour ” from 1975 - 2011 — he was also responsible for bringing “ Monty Python ’ s Flying Circus ” to American television screens. Owen even once attributed his comedy stylings to his father while promoting “ Midnight in Paris ” in 2011."
