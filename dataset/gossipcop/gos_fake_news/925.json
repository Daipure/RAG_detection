    "text": "Last week in Shanghai, Alessandra Ambrosio walked the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show for the last time ever ; and during last night's broadcast, her fans finally got to see her final appearance. The 36 - year - old Angel made two cameos during the show — one wearing the VS x Balmain collab, and another in a red beaded look. The latter marked her VS Fashion Show finale, and she made every step of it count. She even mouthed ` ` I love you forever'' from the front of the stage. Fans were not emotionally prepared to watch the goodbye : I still can ’ t believe this is the last time we ’ re watching Alessandra doing the VS fashion show we ’ re gon na miss her so much # VSFashion"
