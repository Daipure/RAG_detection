We all know — and adore — the love between country power couple Faith Hill and Tim McGraw. And who could forget those who are a couple both professionally and personally, like Thompson Square or Jimi Westbrook and Karen Fairchild from Little Big Town? But these couples are just the top of the heart - shaped cake. This photo gallery includes Luke Bryan, Justin Moore and many more."
