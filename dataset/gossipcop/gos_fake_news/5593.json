    "text": "This story has been updated to reflect the correct date for the season premiere of “ Chicago Fire. ” When the long - running NBC drama “ Chicago Fire ” returns for its seventh season Sept. 26, it will mark a major cast shakeup. Last spring Monica Raymund, who played paramedic ( and for a time, firefighter ) Gabriela Dawson for the show ’ s entire run, announced she was leaving. Cast and crew have been back at work since July, and this is the first year Raymund hasn ’ t been part of that routine. “ It does feel surreal, ” she told me when we spoke this week. “ I mean, I ’ ve given six years of my life to that show and created a family there, so it was a bit like a dismemberment, if you will."
