According to a press release, more than 500 family members and friends attended the ceremony, which was led by local KROQ DJ Ted Stryker. Among those in attendance were Bennington's Stone Temple Pilots bandmates Robert and Dean DeLeo, his Kings of Chaos bandmate Matt Sorum as well as Damon Fox and Jimmy Gnecco. That fivesome performed ` ` Amazing Grace'' at the ceremony. Meanwhile, Dead by Sunrise's Ryan Shuck and Bennington's Linkin Park bandmates Mike Shinoda and Joe Hahn were among those delivering eulogies. One fan has started a Google Doc collating all of the memorials worldwide. Music for Relief has launched the One More Light fund in honor of Bennington."
