    "text": "The first promo for the upcoming show, set for March 4, was also released Monday, featuring clips from this year's films and the memorable best picture flub from the last Oscars. The countdown to the 2018 Oscars has begun, with the ceremony just three months away. And this year, in addition to hopefully avoiding a repeat of last year's memorable best picture flub, the show might even end earlier. ABC and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced Monday that the 90th annual Academy Awards, set for March 4, will start at 8 p. m. ET / 5 p. m. PT, a half - hour earlier than prior telecasts. The Oscars preshow will thus start at 6 : 30 p. m. ET / 3 : 30 p. m."
