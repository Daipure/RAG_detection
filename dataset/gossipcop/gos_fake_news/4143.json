    "text": "Jack ’ s son is now Jack ’ s brother. Michael Angarano, the I ’ m Dying Up Here star who famously played the offspring of Jack ( Sean Hayes ) on Will & Grace, has now been cast in a recurring role as Nicky, the sibling of Jack ( Milo Ventimiglia ) on This Is Us, EW has confirmed. Nicky, of course, served in Vietnam with Jack, and was killed under circumstances viewers don ’ t know yet. Jack rarely spoke of the bespectacled Nicky, who was first seen as a young boy in the season 2 episode “ Brothers, ” and later when Jack looked a photo of himself with Nicky in Vietnam. Jack told his sons in the season 2 episode “ The Car ” that Nicky died in the war. Earl Gibson III / Getty Images ; NBC"
