The latest example comes from chipmaker Nvidia, which published a paper showing how AI can create photorealistic pictures of fake celebrities. Generating fake celebs isn ’ t in itself new, but researchers say these are the most convincing and detailed pictures of their type ever made. The video below shows the process in full, starting with the database of celebrity images the system was trained on. The researchers used what ’ s known as a generative adversarial network, or GAN, to make the pictures. GANs are actually comprised of two separate networks : one that generates the imagery based on the data it ’ s fed, and a second discriminator network ( the adversary ) that"
