    "text": "Steve Carell is well cast as the ex - champ who tried to prove men ’ s superiority on court, but Stone calls the shots as women ’ s No 1 Billie Jean King This is a seductively enjoyable, smart and well - acted film based on the most deadly serious sporting contest of modern times : the Battle of the Sexes tennis match of 1973 in a packed Houston Astrodome. It stars Emma Stone and Steve Carell, respectively women ’ s No 1 Billie Jean King and fiftysomething ex - champ and self - proclaimed “ male chauvinist pig ” Bobby Riggs – fighting to prove that men are better at tennis and better, full stop. The film crucially faces the same challenge as the participants from real life : the challenge of tone. How unseriously should this match be taken?"
