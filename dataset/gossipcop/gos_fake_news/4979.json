    "text": "The seventh and final season of “ New Girl ” debuts Tuesday night. While fans are already mourning the end of the popular Fox comedy series, star Zooey Deschanel said filming the end of the show was not a sad occasion. “ It felt like we were ready for it to be the end, in a bittersweet way, ” Deschanel told Variety. “ But it wasn ’ t difficult. It was like finishing a marathon, like we did this really long run for seven years and we ’ ve played these characters a long time. It ’ s not like there was any unfinished business. It felt like the right time to be ending it in the best way. I ’ m sad not to see my friends that I ’ ve worked with every day for so long, but it was all really positive in the end"
