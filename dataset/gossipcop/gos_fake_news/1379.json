When accepting an award for his work in Fargo, McGregor made sure to thank two of the most important women in his life — his legal wife of 22 years and his rumored girlfriend, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Although McGregor and his wife have been separated since May 2017, people couldn't help but comment on how uncomfortable it was that he brought up both women in a matter of minutes. Oh, and he also called Minnesota accents ` ` bonkers'' — so there's that."
