    "text": "That's a wrap for ` ` Southern Charm New Orleans.'' Sunday night's episode of the unscripted Bravo series marked the finale of its first season - - and, one has to believe, probably the finale of the series as a whole. Of course, the Bravo suits could always surprise us and renew it for a sophomore season. But the fact of the matter is that the show had trouble building a steady audience from the beginning. In fact, after debuting April 25 to more than 1 million viewers, it didn't build at all, posting a viewership decline with nearly every episode, according to figures from ShowBuzz Daily. Last week's penultimate episode marked the low - water mark, drawing fewer viewers - - 640, 000 - - than any other episode so far"
