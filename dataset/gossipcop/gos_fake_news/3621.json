That ’ s because Anthony ’ s ex - wife was a guest at the amazing yacht party along with her son. Earlier in the day, she shared a photo sporting a one - piece bathing suit and the stunning Miami skyline behind her. “ Spring Break ”, she captioned the photo. Then, she posted a photo with Smith on the same yacht and captioned it : “ How was your weekend? Well, I ’ m just here with the king ”, she wrote. Marc and Shannon continue to enjoy their friendship because last year the friendly exes also hung out for a boat day."
