Danica Patrick and Aaron Rodgers couldn't keep their eyes off each other while they made their red carpet debut as a couple at the 2018 ESPY Awards at Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on Wednesday. The 36 - year - old race car driver showed off her fit and toned figure in a one - shoulder black velvet mini dress that featured gold circular details. She paired the killer ensemble with black gladiator heels, soft makeup and her hair in a low ponytail. The Green Bay Packers quarterback looked suave in a navy tuxedo with black lapels and a white button - up shirt with a black bow - tie. The two looked so in love as they smiled at each other on the red carpet"
