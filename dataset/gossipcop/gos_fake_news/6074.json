    "text": "Gabrielle Union is the newest victim of being in the wrong place at the wrong time — still, she's not taking any blame for somehow getting sucked into Hollywood's latest scandal. Earlier this week, Tristan Thompson made headlines for all the wrong reasons when TMZ reported that the NBA star cheated on then - pregnant girlfriend Khloe Kardashian a handful of times ( Kardashian has since given birth ) — first, on April 7 during an outing in New York City, and before then, during an October 2017 encounter. In one incriminating photo posted to The Shade Room's Instagram account, Union mysteriously pops up behind one of Thompson's alleged flings. But the actress wasted no time immediately shutting down the idea that she had anything to do with any of it."
