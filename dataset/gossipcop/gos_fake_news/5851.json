The royal couple was joined by their kids Prince George, 4, and Princess Charlotte, 2, while their newborn son Prince Louis stayed at home this time. The little girl in the pink dress is Savannah Phillips, who is the daughter of Will â€˜ s cousin Peter Phillips. Kate rode in the parade in a carriage with her mother - in - law Duchess Camilla while William rode on horseback alongside his dad Prince Charles. Queen Elizabeth was in a carriage next to the heirs to the throne. Make sure to check out photos of Kate making her debut in the parade back in 2011! FYI : Kate is wearing an Alexander McQueen dress and a Juliette Botterill hat."
