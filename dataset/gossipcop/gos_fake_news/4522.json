    "text": "Barring a fluke, Aquaman will probably cross $ 500 million worldwide sometime today or very early tomorrow. The DC Films superhero flick has earned $ 483m worldwide, including $ 72. 7m in its domestic debut, so it should be over / under $ 80m domestic by the end of today. For reference, National Treasure fell 40 % on its first Monday on Christmas Eve after a $ 44m debut weekend in 2007 while The Hobbit : An Unexpected Journey, which opened a week earlier in 2012, fell 60 % on day four after a then - record $ 84m Fri - Sun haul. So, yeah, barring an unexpected collapse, the Jason Momoa / Amber Heard adventure is already a sizable hit for the Dream Factory, and it â€™ s on course to be their biggest"
