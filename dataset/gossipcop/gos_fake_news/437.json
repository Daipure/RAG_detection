    "text": "Hugh Hefner's impact on the entertainment industry extended far beyond the pages of his magazine. The Playboy founder passed away Wednesday ( September 27 ) at the age of 91, leading to an outpouring of celebrity reactions across social media. He leaves behind a legacy as a champion of sexual freedom, as well as civil and equal rights. But he was also a player on the small screen. Yes, he became a hero to a new generation of fans with his E! reality series, The Girls Next Door, but he also oversaw the creation of The Playboy Channel ( now Playboy TV ) back in 1982 in the early days of cable TV, making him a visionary on the, ahem, boob tube. Hefner would also often play himself in a wide range of shows, whether animated or live - action."
