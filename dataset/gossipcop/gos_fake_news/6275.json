    "text": "Shailene Woodley simply gave us a style of the way forward for vogue. The actress arrived to the L. A. premiere of Adrift in a silver Rochas costume that seemed forward of its time. The feel of the material mirrored gentle like foil, whereas the silhouette had a extra retro really feel. Paired with darkish tresses and bangs, the general look channeled a mature vibe that works for the Massive Little Lies star. The week in superstar fashion additionally served up loads of daring colours and textures, as seen on Olivia Munn and Anne Hathaway. The actresses unintentionally had a runway walk - off, showing in a number of colourful, eye - catching ensembles worthy of journal editorials."
