    "text": "“ Mission : Impossible – Fallout, ” the sixth ( and best ) entry in Tom Cruise ’ s action franchise, is 147 minutes of relentless action, convoluted and shocking twists and lots of Tom Cruise running. Between the stunning fights, chases and helicopter shootouts, you can be forgiven for losing track of the plot, which doesn ’ t really matter anyway. That ’ s because “ Fallout ” opens with a giant exposition dump that encourages you to just sit back and have fun ; don ’ t bother trying to make sense of it all. So that you don ’ t have to sweat the small stuff, we ’ re here to help fill in the blanks. ( SPOILERS FOLLOW!!! ) Also Read :'Mission Impossible : Fallout'Film Review : Cruise -"
