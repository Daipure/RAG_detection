    "text": "Lady Gaga is a queen, and in case you somehow forgot, her latest outing should remind you. While most people ( including celebrities ) do their grocery shopping on foot, Gaga proved once again that she isn't like most people when she was photographed casually being pushed around by her fiancé, Christian Carino, in a shopping cart at a grocery store in Malibu, CA, on Thursday. In addition to her unique mode of transportation, Gaga was dressed in a fur coat, a black dress, and matching heels — you know, as one dresses for the occasion. Gaga and Christian first struck up a romance earlier this year and reportedly got engaged over the Summer. It's been a while since we've seen them out together, but from the looks of it, they're doing great."
