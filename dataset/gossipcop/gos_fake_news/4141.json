Before that began, Lillian Garcia ( who moderated ) spoke to the Bellas about turning on WWE Raw Women's Champion Ronda Rousey, which has now led to Nikki receiving a title shot at WWE Evolution on October 28. Nikki also noted that she wanted the current title added to her resume, something beyond her reign as Divas Champion. ` ` I guess that was the only way to get my match,'' Nikki said. ` ` I had to turn on her, she's the champ. I've been here for 12 years, she hasn't, so I have to teach her a lesson.... I need to have a reign that [ goes beyond ]"
