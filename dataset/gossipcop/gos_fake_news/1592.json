The two of them danced together but their moves were determined by a dance move generator. As Fallon explained, “ We ’ ll randomly select a never - before - seen dance move. Whoever ’ s turn it is has to make up a dance for that move. The best dancer wins. ” The two stars danced to “ Invisible Hula Hoop, ” “ Fork in the Garbage Disposal, ” “ Speed Bowling, ” “ Mom Tries Hip - Hop, ” “ Eggs ‘ N Bacon ”. Hard to imagine?
