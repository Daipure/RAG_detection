    "text": "In this file photo, actor Steve Carell, center and the cast of ` ` The Office'' accept the future classic award on stage at the TV Land Awards on June 8, 2008, in Santa Monica, Calif. Ready to go back to Dunder Mifflin? NBC is reportedly planning to revive ` ` The Office,'' according to TVLine. Steve Carell will not be returning as Michael Scott, but the new series would involve a mix of old and new characters, all working at the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of everybody's favorite paper company. This plan no doubt comes as a result of the success of ` ` Will & Grace,'' which recently returned from the dead and came back to NBC after more than 10 years off the air. ` ` The Office'' ended in 2013"
