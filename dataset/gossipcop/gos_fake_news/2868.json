    "text": "UPDATE : When Riverdale ‘ s Lili Reinhart first discussed her struggles in dealing with depression in a Saturday Twitter thread, she was called out for minimizing the mood disorder. But a few hours later, she clapped back at her critics with another brief thread. “ I in no way meant that depressed people should ‘ stop being sad,'” Reinhart said. “ I ’ ve dealt with depression my whole f — ing life, so obviously I know that. I ’ m saying find yourself some help. And don ’ t wait for things to change. You have to go out and get that for yourself. ” She also touched upon the steps she had to take to find happiness : “ That ’ s what I did when I moved to L. A. for the second time trying to follow my dream."
