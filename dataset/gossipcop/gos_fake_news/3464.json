The Bad Liar songstress has recently become the proud homeowner of the gorgeous Studio City, Calif. abode, which she bought for a “ modest ’ amount of $ 2. 25 million. Of course, any property worth seven figures is not a bargain, but given the fact that Hollywood just adores massive mansions ( also paired with massive price tags ), Gomez scored quite a deal with her new mansion. The newly remodeled pad rings in at 3, 188 square feet, and it features four bedrooms, four bathrooms, and also two spacious walk - in closets with enough room for Selena ’ s enormous and enviable wardrobe. Gomez ’ s new spread is all about the details"
