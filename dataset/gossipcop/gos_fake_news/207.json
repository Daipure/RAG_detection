    "text": "If you stayed for the credits after Doctor Strange last year ( of course you did ) you saw the titular Sorcerer Supreme have a little sit down with Chris Hemsworth ‘ s Thor over some beer. So it only makes sense that Benedict Cumberbatch ‘ s Doctor will drop by Thor : Ragnarok. The latest trailer for the Taika Waititi movie doesn ’ t feature a ton of new footage, but does give us a look at Doctor Strange dropping in. The Japanese trailer opens with Thor in the Sanctum Sanctorum as the sorcerer flaunts his Cloak of Levitation and telling the God of Thunder that he senses “ a great change ” in Thor ’ s future. You may notice that Hemsworth is sporting the same clothing he wore in the Doctor Strange post - credits scene,"
