Just weeks after the “ Family Guy ” creator was recognized with calling out sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein in a joke made years ago, another past joke has surfaced from his animated series, this one targeting actor Kevin Spacey. In a 2005 episode of “ Family Guy, ” character Stewie Griffin, a talking 1 - year - old who ’ s voiced by MacFarlane, is seen running naked through a store while screaming “ Help! I ’ ve escaped from Kevin Spacey ’ s basement! ” Family Guy with a Kevin Spacey reference twelve years ago... creepy. pic. twitter. com / KLXT5MHVxU — Steve ( @ Stevie _ Beee ) October 30, 2017 The joke"
