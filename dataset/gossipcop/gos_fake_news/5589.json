Fox boss Dana Walden addressed reporters ahead of the network's upfront presentation and opened up about the decision to swap out Crawford for Seann William Scott. ` ` It was not our choice,'' Walden admitted, before saying that Warner Bros. TV were the ones who made the decision. ` ` Our partners at Warner Bros. came to us three weeks ago that they could not deliver Lethal Weapon as we had known it before,'' she explained. ` ` There were some real challenges in the cast.''
