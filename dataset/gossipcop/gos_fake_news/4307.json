    "text": "For the season finale of ` ` Hollywood Medium,'' psychic Tyler Henry connected with the granddaddy of all spirits : Michael Jackson. The medium met with La Toya Jackson for the reading, where the musician's untimely death in 2009 was the main topic of conversation for all parties involved. ` ` I have had a reading before, and I'm not always a believer,'' Jackson admitted before the reading. ` ` Because you don't know if they're reading you form information the know or not. I can not wait to see what he tells me.'' Even before Henry learned who he'd be doing a reading for, he was getting vibes from the other side, with references to a furry bird sitting on someone's shoulder and someone's premature passing on"
