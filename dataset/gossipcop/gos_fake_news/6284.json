    "text": "Roseanne Barr was booted off the air Tuesday following a racist tweet in which she attacked former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett. Some ( okay, Fox News ) jumped to defend Barr's right to free speech, an idiotic argument when no government body was involved in the cancellation of her show. What happened is Barr learned that there are consequences for spewing racist shit across Twitter. She lost her show, she lost people's respect, and she lost money. A lot of it. With the cancellation of Roseanne, Barr is taking a multi - million - dollar hit. Variety reports that she made an estimated $ 250, 000 per episode in the first rebooted season, of which there were nine episodes. That got her $ 2. 25 million for one season of work. We don't know how long"
