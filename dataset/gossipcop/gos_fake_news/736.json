    "text": "By far one of the best embodiments of a comic book character on screen has to be Hugh Jackman. His take on Wolverine over the course of about two decades was great. It was also the high point of just about every X - Men film. When his run finally ended with this year ’ s Logan, many of us held out some hope to see him dawn the classic blue and yellow costume from the comics. Just like his close friend Deadpool ’ s Ryan Reynolds, Jackman is known to jump on Twitter to have some fun with fans. Yesterday morning, Jackman went on Twitter to tease fans about what he ’ s going to wear for Halloween this year. Just maybe I will finally wear blue and yellow spandex for my # halloweencostume # tootall pic. twitter"
