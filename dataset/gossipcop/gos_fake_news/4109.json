    "text": "Game of Thrones might be the most intense show on TV, but it's not always so intense to make it. We imagine the HBO fantasy series can be so wearing that you have to have fun behind the scenes, and that's exactly what it appears this close - knit cast does.

From blooper reels to their social media accounts, see what crazy stuff happens on the Game of Thrones set when they yell ` ` Cut!''"
