Splash News Earlier this week, Bella Thorne took to Snapchat to show off a large bouquet of flowers that she received. A few hours later, Kourtney Kardashian took to Snapchat to show off a huge bouquet of flowers that she received. Both sets of flowers looking quite similar in size, type and color. According to multiple reports, the flowers were sent to both women by Scott - - perhaps as a bit of mea culpa for his recent behavior. TMZ ( who has images of the flowers ) reported on June 15 that Bella's flowers were indeed sent from Scott. Bella shared the image in which her hair matched the color of the roses. `"
