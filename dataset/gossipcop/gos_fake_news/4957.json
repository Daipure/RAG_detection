Video of the incident seemingly shows the victim instigating the fight after being denied contact with the rapper. They ’ ve since contacted a lawyer. So the “ Bodak Yellow ” artist took to Twitter to set the record straight. “ If you check my tag pics, I take a lot of pics with fans, ” she tweeted yesterday, which has now been deleted. “ Some people are not fans and sometimes I don ’ t want no pics and I simply don ’ t want people too close cause of [ my pregnancy ]. I don ’ t know what are people ’ s intentions sooo I be careful. Why can ’ t people respect that? ”"
