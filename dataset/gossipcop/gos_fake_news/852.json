    "text": "Columbia, SC ( WLTX ) - Facebook wants your nudes. That's what many articles say online, so we did some fact checking and sent an email to Facebook asking if this were true. According to a Facebook spokesperson we were told that yes, Facebook is collecting ` ` intimate'' photos in an Australian Pilot Program. ` ` This is a pilot program that allows users who are concerned that their intimate images will be shared on Facebook's services without consent,'' the spokesperson said. Users can complete an online eSafety Commissioner's form detailing their concerns and then send the images to themselves through Facebook's Messenger App. Once Facebook receives the notification from the Australian Office of the eSafety Commissioner, they say that they will ` ` prevent any instances of the image being uploaded or shared"
