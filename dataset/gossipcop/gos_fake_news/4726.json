    "text": "If the living room was a body, the coffee table would be its heart. It ’ s where we gather to watch television, chat with friends, sip a cup of morning ( or late - evening ) joe, and relax with our feet up, unwinding from a day of stress. But aside from a candle here and there and a water - circle stain or two, many rarely ever decorate one of the most central pieces of furniture in our house. Have no fear, celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, Cameron Diaz, and Mary - Kate and Ashley Olsen are here to help. As many home - decor lovers know, one of the easiest ways to jazz up a coffee table is with a book. And, no, we don ’ t mean beaten - down paperback novels from high school."
