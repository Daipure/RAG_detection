Simon Cowell was a judge on “ American Idol ” during Kelly Clarkson ’ s season and, as someone who was known to be incredibly hard to impress, Simon clearly has a soft spot in his heart for KC. He met Kelly on stage after she ’ d performed “ Whole Lotta Woman, ” giving her a huge hug. “ Hi everyone, ” he said to the crowd. “ That was bloody fantastic. What can I say? I ’ m very proud of you. ” So sweet!"
