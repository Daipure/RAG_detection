While in Orlando to celebrate the opening of his new ride at Universal Studios Orlando, Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon welcomed our 2017 SI Swimsuit cover model onto his show and in turn challeneged her to a friendly ( read : competitive ) dance battle. In the contest, Kate and Jimmy were each given unique prompts by a dance - move generator and were tasked with creating new signature moves on the spot.
