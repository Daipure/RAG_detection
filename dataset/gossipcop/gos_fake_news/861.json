    "text": "As indicated by the feisty lead single ` ` Look What You Made Me Do'' and bold pre - album - release track ` `... Ready For It?,'' reputation is Swift's most attitude - filled album yet. Still, it wouldn't be a Taylor Swift album without love weaved in its fabric. It's been widely reported that Swift is currently in a relationship with British actor Joe Alwyn, and by the looks of some of her lyrics throughout the album, they are very happy together. That said, with reputation only hours old, we don't have nearly enough evidence to know the meanings behind these songs for certain. But even without knowing specific details and stories that led to the creation of this tracklist, one thing is plainly clear : Swift's songwriting"
