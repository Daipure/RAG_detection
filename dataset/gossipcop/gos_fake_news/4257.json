    "text": "Not all five Spice Girls were invited to the royal wedding, Page Six reports. Apparently, only Victoria Beckham ( who attended William and Kate's wedding in 2011 ), Geri Halliwell and Emma Bunton are on the guest list, a source told the celeb news site. That means only Posh Spice, Ginger Spice and Baby Spice will be present, while Sporty Spice ( Mel C ) and Scary Spice ( Mel B ) are MIA. To put salt in our wounds, the insider added that Spice Girls ` ` were never going to perform'' at the wedding in the first place. This news follows previous reports that the whole girl gang had received invites for the May 19 nuptials. And now, Mel C has spoken out about being left"
