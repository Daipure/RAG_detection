    "text": "Russell Simmons has proclaimed his innocence following numerous rape allegations leveled against him — but the NYPD apparently isn ’ t so eager to take his word for it. A spokesman for the NYPD told TheWrap on Thursday that the department has received information regarding allegations against the music mogul in the New York City area, and that detectives are in the process of reviewing the information. The review comes a day after the New York Times reported that three women had accused Simmons of rape — former Def Jam Records employee Drew Dixon, former music journalist Toni Sallie and performer Tina Baker. The three women said that Simmons raped them in separate incidents that spanned from 1988 to 2014.
