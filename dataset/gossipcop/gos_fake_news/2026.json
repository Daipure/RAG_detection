    "text": "While we definitely don't envy anyone who has to wear full - length trousers to work all summer long, even on the most oppressively humid days, it's nice to have the option of a breezy pair of pants to throw on instead of a dress once in a while. Especially as cooler August nights set in, wide - leg styles in linen, cotton, and silk are becoming especially appealing, and they look far more elegant than denim cutoffs ever could. Try wearing Madewell's white culottes to brunch with a silk blouse styled off the shoulders and tied in the front, or opt for an ankle - grazing striped pair with a crisp white tee and simple leather sandals. Because they're so versatile, they're also a great choice to toss in your suitcase for weekend"
