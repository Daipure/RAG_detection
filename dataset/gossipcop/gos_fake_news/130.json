    "text": "THE BEST BET : The Power Mediterranean Chicken Salad ( the half - size is actually really generous ), which is loaded with grilled chicken, feta, and a blend of quinoa, chickpeas, white beans, roasted veggies, and sundried tomatoes. Skip the hummus / sauce that comes with it, and just get the balsamic vinaigrette packet. PRO TIP : Get their standard beef patty lettuce - wrapped, which comes with tomato and onion — sans cheese and mayo. If you ’ re craving French fries, go for an OG baked potato ( leave the sour cream, take the chives )."
