    "text": "Raven Gates and Adam Gottschalk may not be the most famous couple to come out of the Bachelor franchise, but they seem like one of the more grounded ones. Gates, a 27 - year - old business owner from Arkansas, and Gottschalk, a 28 - year - old commercial real - estate agent in Dallas, are living together almost a year and a half after they met shooting Bachelor in Paradise in 2017. That â€™ s nothing to sneeze at for a franchise that is ostensibly all about love but has been panned for not producing many lasting relationships. Bachelor in Paradise couple Adam Gottschalk and Raven Gates, seen at Elle Fitness in Toronto last Friday, say keeping most of their relationship private has been a key to making it work.
