    "text": "Gigi Hadid is always an RSVP ` ` yes'' to Fashion month, so it was just a matter of waiting for her appearances. And with that, her many outfit changes. Gigi has a variety of casual looks for day and night, which you'll see ahead. In between her street - style ensembles, the model channels a completely different persona with each runway show she's in. Take Moschino for example, where she channeled the late Jackie O. Check out what Gigi wore for all of fashion month, then catch up on the best street style from Paris Fashion Week."
