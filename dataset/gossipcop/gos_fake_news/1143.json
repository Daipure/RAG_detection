Created in 2003 by writer Brian K. Vaughan and artist Adrian Alphona, the original comic prompted Marvel to consider a Runaways movie, which reached early casting stages before being shelved in the early aughts. Enter Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage, a pair of TV veterans with experience making both a California - based teen soap ( The O. C. ) and an adaptation of YA source material ( Gossip Girl ). They bring Runaways to the screen as Marvel Television ’ s first series for Hulu, where it stands separate from the studio ’ s other shows on Netflix and ABC."
