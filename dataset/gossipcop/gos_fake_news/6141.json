    "text": "The 2018 MTV Video Music Awards are going solo. Monday night ’ s show will air without a proper host, a representative for MTV confirmed. It ’ s not the first time the VMAs opted out of a traditional emcee. Katy Perry took over the reigns last year after a similarly hostless show in 2016. Back in 2011, a series of high - profile presenters stepped in to steer the program ( Remember Lady Gaga as the iconic Jo Calderone? ). Luckily, Jennifer Lopez won ’ t have to worry about handing herself the Video Vanguard Award ( although, given her work ethic, she ’ d find a way ). The list of VMAs ’ presenters includes Tiffany Haddish, Kevin Hart, Millie Bobby Brown and Amandla Stenberg. This year, Cardi B leads the way"
