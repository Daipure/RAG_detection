As MTV News reports, the two characters met during winter break at a ski lodge, where they wound up singing a karaoke duet, ` ` Start of Something New.'' ( The movie technically hit theaters on January 20, 2006, but the story began on December 31, 2005. ) After the song ended, the clock struck midnight, and Troy and Gabriella thought they would never see each other again... that is, until Gabriella happened to move to Troy's high school! You know how the rest of the story goes, of course : they end up dating by the end of the first movie,"
