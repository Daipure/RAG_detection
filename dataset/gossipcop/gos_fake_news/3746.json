    "text": "In its third season, “ The Magicians ” has no intention of resting on its laurels. In addition to a quest to restore magic, exploring a character ’ s posthumous escapades, and depicting silent scenes as characters communicate exclusively in American Sign Language, the Syfy series is embarking upon a musical episode. The idea came from executive producer John McNamara. After seeing the one - time performance of “ One Day More ” take off with audiences in the second season, he wanted to go all in. “ Right around the time we realized the ‘ Les Miserables ’ number last year was going to work, John was like, ‘ So next season I have this idea for how to do an episode where all of the talking is singing,'” executive producer Sera Gamble tells Variety."
