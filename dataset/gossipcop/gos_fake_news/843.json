In several of the songs, the ` ` Look What You Made Me Do'' singer seems to be calling out those who have wronged her, including Kanye and Kim Kardashian - West. ` ` It was so nice being friends again / There I was, giving you a second chance / But then you stabbed my back while shaking my hand,'' she sings in ` ` This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things.''"
