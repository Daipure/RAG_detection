    "text": "[ This story contains major spoilers from the entire sixth season, including the finale, of Netflix's Orange Is the New Black. ] Orange Is the New Black had a lot to say about freedom, time and the current climate with its supersized finale â€” aptly titled ` ` Be Free.'' Jenji Kohan's prison dramedy ended its sixth season ( which bowed Friday on Netflix ) with a game - changing twist for the show's most dedicated viewers : leading inmate Piper Chapman ( played by Taylor Schilling ) was let out of prison on early release. Despite having eight months left on her prison sentence, Piper was pushed to the top of Litchfield's inmate release pile and she gained her freedom back in the final moments of the 84 - minute finale."
