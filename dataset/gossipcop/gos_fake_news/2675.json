    "text": "Beyoncé and JAY - Z have reportedly left the hospital with their newborn twins and arrived in a new, temporary home — a luxurious 6 - acre oceanfront estate in Malibu, which they're renting for $ 400, 000 a month. Named La Villa Contenta, the private property boasts ` ` a library / study, gourmet kitchen, wine cellar, full gym, movie theater and large terraces with ocean views,'' according to Trulia. Blue Ivy and her newly - welcomed siblings will be living large at the rental this summer, especially with a ` ` kiddie - friendly wading pool.'' The first thing guests see when entering the lavish 10 bedroom and 14 bathroom home, is a foyer fit for Queen Bey, decked in colored tiles, golden fixtures and a wrought iron staircase."
