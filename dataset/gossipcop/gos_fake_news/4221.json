    "text": "It was a typical morning for everyone working on The Big Bang Theory on Wednesday until the entire cast was summoned to co - creator / executive producer Chuck Lorre â€™ s office after the table read with no advance notice and no agenda. Many people on the show felt it might have been a meeting to discuss a possible 13th season, as CBS had started talks with producer Warner Bros TV about anther two - season pickup, though the actors had not yet been approached by the studio for new deals. Instead, I hear Lorre gave the floor to star Jim Parsons, who made a tearful announcement that he would not be continuing on the series beyond the upcoming 12th season. With the entire room still reeling from the shock, I hear Lorre revealed that the series too would end with Season 12. Yesterday was a very emotional day in the offices"
