    "text": "Arrow wrapped up its fifth season last night. The season finale was a mixed bag, just like the rest of Season 5. Unlike many other critics who are singing the finale's praises, calling it the best episode ever, or calling the fifth season the best season ever, I'm left feeling deeply divided. I disagree with IGN's claim that this was the best episode ever, though it had some good moments, and I disagree with Paul Tassi that this was the best season ever. That still belongs to Season 2, for reasons I'll get into momentarily. Spoilers follow. The Good The Villain We'll start with what worked both in the finale and the season. Adrian Chase was a great villain, certainly the best since Slade Wilson in Season 2. He puts Oliver in a real bind,"
