    "text": "Jennifer Lawrence and Darren Aronofsky have sparked rumors that they're back together again after attending an event together last night. To recap : Aronofsky and Lawrence started dating after making the movie Mother! together. They were spotted kissing in New York in October 2016, but went on to split up in November 2017. Having spent just over a year together, the actress and director remained friends, and have been spotted together on several occasions since. Photographed looking very much like a couple, Lawrence and Aronofsky reunited in Brooklyn last night for the BAM Gala 2018 honoring Darren Aronofsky, Jeremy Irons, and Nora Ann Wallace. Posing at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal together, the actress and director had their arms around each other, and didn't look unhappy to see one another at all"
