That was until Thursday when former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman released a secret recording of a conversation with Lara Trump. Manigault Newman played the recording on MSNBC to bolster her contention that Trump ’ s loyal daughter - in - law tried to buy her silence after she was fired from the White House staff. On the recording, Lara Trump, a senior member of the president ’ s 2020 campaign, can be heard offering Manigault Newman a $ 15, 000 - a - month contract to work in his re - election campaign"
