    "text": "The cult classic Disney movie that became a staple of Halloween night marathons for millennials across the country is getting its highly demanded resurrection — but probably not as Hocus Pocus fans would have liked. Hocus Pocus is returning from the grave as a TV movie remake without any of the original cast. Which … feels more like a trick than a treat. The Hocus Pocus remake will be a reimagining of the 1993 live - action classic, which originally starred Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy as the fabulous, scene - stealing witches who terrorize the children of Salem after they were accidentally resurrected. Disney Channel is currently developing the remake with The Royals ’ Scarlett Lacey working on the screenplay and original movie producer David Kirschner on board to executive produce, according to Deadline"
