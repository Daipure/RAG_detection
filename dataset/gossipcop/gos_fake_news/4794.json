    "text": "Gwyneth Paltrow and her 14 - year - old daughter, Apple Martin, look like twins in a rare new photo the actress shared on Instagram yesterday in honor of National Daughters Day. Martin may be rocking cherry red hair in the shot, but she still looks identical to her famous mom. ` ` Happy # nationaldaughtersday Apple Martin, it ’ s like I conjured you from a dream, you make my life,'' Paltrow wrote. The Goop founder shares Apple and 12 - year - old son Moses with her ex - husband, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin. Paltrow rarely shares details about her kids, but she recently posted a photo of them hanging out in her backyard at the end of summer, writing, ` ` Noooooo summer don ’ t go. '"
