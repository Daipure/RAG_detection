    "text": "Harry Styles was groped onstage by a fan during a performance in L. A. on Saturday, October 22, and the Twitterverse was not happy about it. The incident, which was captured on camera by some audience members, happened when the former One Direction singer was singing his hit “ Kiwi ” at the Hollywood Bowl during the We Can Survive concert to benefit breast cancer awareness. As he got down on his knees near the front of the stage, a fan grabbed at his crotch. Styles appeared briefly disturbed by it and quickly swatted away the person ’ s hand, continuing his performance, but a moment later as he headed back towards the opposite edge of the stage, he covered his groin with his hand, clearly not willing to get grabbed for a second time. WTF!!! When your favorite"
