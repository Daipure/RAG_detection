    "text": "In her first broadcast interview since departing Celebrity Big Brother Monday evening, Keshia Knight Pulliam joined the ladies of The Talk to discuss her time on the show. She talked about being reunited with her baby after leaving the house, as well as her thoughts on the show more broadly and her eviction from the house. For Pulliam, a major reason for her exit from the show was returning to her child. “ Family is always going to win out for me, I didn ’ t have any more days to be away from my daughter, ” she said. “ These were the same group of people who were in my alliance who a couple of days earlier had completely lied … I had to make a decision because this wasn ’ t about game play to me, this was about real life, this was about my child."
