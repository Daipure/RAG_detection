    "text": "After years of will they - won ’ t they, CBS this season finally did a celebrity installment of its summer reality staple Big Brother. The experiment went well, and now the network has ordered a second installment. CBS would not specify whether it would air during the regular 2018 - 19 season but another winter run is the assumption. Launched as a counter - programming to the Winter Olympics on NBC, Celebrity Big Brother did the job — keeping the lights on for CBS against the highly - rated Olympic Games. The voyeuristic show also made a lot of noise, generating a slew of headlines, mostly based on comments house guest Omarosa made about her tenure in the White House. Celebrity Big Brother comes from Endemol Shine North America."
