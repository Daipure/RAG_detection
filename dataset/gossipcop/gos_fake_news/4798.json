    "text": "Using a randomizer on The Ellen Show, Eva got some great suggestions for potential baby names! The actress wants to give her baby a Spanish name, so Ellen had the randomizer produce some good ones. Some of the names Eva and Ellen came up with include Don Julio, Poquito Mas, and Tequila Sunrise â€” ` ` Teeqy Sunny'' for short, of course. But the real winner was Cinco de Mayo! Which happens to be the day Eva's holding her baby shower. It's perfect! Eva is currently seven months pregnant with her husband Jose Baston's baby! She told Ellen she's due in June."
