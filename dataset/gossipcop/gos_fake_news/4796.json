    "text": "When Pretty Little Liars and Teen Wolf collide we get Truth or Dare. Well, not really, but we thankfully get Lucy Hale and Tyler Posey starring alongside each other in the latest must - see scary movie, which is almost better than two of our favorite shows being brought back to life. The duo stopped by On Air With Ryan Seacrest on Friday, April 13, ( Friday the 13th to make it all the better ), and dished on everything from their belief in paranormal and witches to that creepy possessed sex scene we get a sneak of in the Truth or Dare trailer. In the film, Tyler and Lucy play Lucas and Olivia, two college seniors who, while on spring break in Mexico, get sucked into a life - or - death game of truth or dare that ends up following them back home. â€œ"
