    "text": "Two veteran stunt women have come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct by famed stunt coordinator Joel Kramer. One involves a 10th grade girl who came to the North Carolina set of Virus in the spring of 1997 to see how movies are made, while a second woman claims that more than 30 years ago Kramer forced her to perform oral sex on him. The latest claims come after Eliza Dushku accused Kramer this weekend of sexually molesting her during the making of the 1994 movie True Lies when she was 12 years old. Kramer, who for many years was Arnold Schwarzenegger ’ s personal stunt double, has denied Dushku ’ s allegations. But he acknowledged that few years later, he had a sexual encounter with the 16 - year - old friend of the 15 - year - old sister of a stunt woman who worked for him"
