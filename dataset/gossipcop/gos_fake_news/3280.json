    "text": "It seemed to be curtains for Missy ( played by Michelle Gomez ) after she was struck by a fatal swipe from The Master during season 10's tense finale, The Doctor Falls. While Michelle officially announced her departure from Doctor Who earlier this year, she seems to have partially rescinded that statement at San Diego's Comic - con yesterday. When asked whether she could return, the 50 - year - old was coy, saying : ` ` Probably not. I think that's enough of Missy now. ` ` It's good to know when to leave the part. It was a jolly good party, but time to leave - and then maybe come back, but time to leave for now."
