    "text": "“ Once Upon a Time ” fans may need to bid farewell to yet another character. Lana Parrilla, who is one of few core cast members returning for the ABC drama ’ s rebooted seventh season, told reporters at the Television Critics Association ’ s summer press tour that her Evil Queen character will no longer go by her Storybrooke name of Regina Mills. “ I don ’ t think her name is Regina, and that ’ s cool, ” the actress said. “ I ’ m no longer in pantsuits — I ’ m in denim and rock T - shirts. When we meet her, this other version of Regina, she ’ s working in a bar. She ’ s a little rough around the edges. ” Also Read :'Once Upon a Time': Creators Defend Cast Shakeup"
