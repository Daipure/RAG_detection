    "text": "Jay - Z ’ s 4 : 44 has landed exclusively on Tidal and, like his wife Beyoncé ’ s smash hit Lemonade in 2016, it is peppered with moments of thoughtful introspection about the troubled waters in their seemingly idyllic marriage. Savor it, folks, because this is as close as any of us will ever come to knowing what goes on behind closed doors in the Carter household. On 4 : 44, Jay addresses allegations of infidelity, his infamous fight with sister - in - law Solange Knowles after the Met Gala in 2014 and even alludes to the mysterious “ Becky with the good hair, ” an apparent lover that Beyoncé called out on Lemonade. 4 : 44 feels solemn. Here, on his 13th studio album, Jay is an artist with nothing to prove and nothing to lose."
