    "text": "Kate Gosselin celebrated her sextuplets 13th birthday on Monday's all new episode of Kate Plus 8, but one of the reality star's children was noticeably missing from the festivities - - her son, Collin. Five of Kate's sextuplets - - Aaden, Alexis, Hannah, Leah and Joel - - had a great time at their camping - themed party, which was filmed back in May, and included fun activities and tents set up in their back yard. As part of their celebration, the boys foraged for supplies that their mom had hidden around the property, and went on a scavenger hunt while learning how to use a compass. They also cooked their own food - - like corn and hot dogs - - over a camp fire. WATCH : Gosselin Family"
