Through the years, her style has evolved, but she's consistently proved herself to be quite the fashionista, especially on Country Music's Biggest Night, at the CMA Awards. Underwood has donned everything from short and sparkly dresses to downright glamorous gowns, and the ` ` Smoke Break'' hitmaker can pull off every single color of the rainbow, from tangerine orange to kelly green. Now that she's entering into her 11th year as co - host of the CMAs, Underwood's outfit changes throughout the show are expected - - looked forward to, even - - and she rarely disappoints."
