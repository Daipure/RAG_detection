    "text": "Clearing the air. Cheryl Cole confronted reports that her mother, Joan Callaghan, influenced her split from Liam Payne. “ I hate responding to stuff esp at such difficult times but I can not sit here and listen to such nasty, false articles regarding my mam. I don ’ t know why they involve her in stores about me, ” the “ Call My Name ” songstress, 35, tweeted on Monday, July 2. “ I can assure you she has absolutely nothing to do with any of it. I am a grown woman who is capable of dealing with my own life. She is a soft and kind woman who doesn ’ t deserve to be dragged into something that has nothing whatsoever to do with her. ” Cole ’ s statement comes one day after she and Payne, 24, revealed their split."
