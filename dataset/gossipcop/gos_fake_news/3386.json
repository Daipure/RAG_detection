Not only does she have kickass style ( no one else can rock socks with sandals quite like her ), but she also treats her boys to yearly trips to Disneyland and knows that life is all about balance ( like eating a hot dog in a Versace dress ). So when the Canadian songstress took her six - year - old twins out on the town while in Paris this week, we weren't surprised. We were, however, surprised to see her boys, Nelson and Eddy, looking all grown up! The boys were dressed casual - cool as they stopped to pose for photographers with their famous mom. Celine Dion went shopping in Paris with her 6 - year - old twins and they're all grown up!"
