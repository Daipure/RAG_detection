Christie Brinkley, 64, and daughter Sailor Brinkley - Cook, 20, showed off their fit physiques and twinned in workout gear at the Southampton Sweat event this weekend. While Christie dressed in head - to - toe white for the Hamptons event, including a mesh Alo top, cropped leggings, sports bra and athletic sneakers, Sailor showed her abs in an olive Adidas sports bra and leggings. Nearly two years ago, Christie and Sailor, along with Alexa Ray Joel, posed together in bikinis for the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, which Sailor called a “ very empowering and liberating ” experience.
