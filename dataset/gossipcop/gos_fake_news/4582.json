The Real Housewives of New York City mogul shared with a fan on Twitter that the new man in her life ` ` saved my life.'' Bethenny later went into further detail about how this special someone's quick thinking and his springing into action immediately after she came down with an allergic reaction ensured that she didn't ultimately lose her life. ` ` Thanks for all of the support. I was with someone who went to get me a @ Benadryl & returned & I was unconscious,'' Bethenny tweeted. ` ` He managed to call 911 & get pill down my throat [ with ] water. He saved my life.'' Thanks"
