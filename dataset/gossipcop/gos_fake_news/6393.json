Production on Season 3 of This Is Us began Tuesday in Los Angeles, and show creator Dan Fogelman is already tweeting sneak peeks of the feel - good family action. The first photo is of one of the camera monitors revealing Randall ( Sterling K. Brown ) and Beth ( Susan Kelechi Watson ) in a moment of celebration. See? Watson wasn't lying that Beth is alright. Everyone can take a sigh of relief. We don't know yet exactly when Season 3 of This Is Us will pick up with the Pearsons, but it looks like the first scene might be a little while after ( or before ) Kate's ( Chrissy Metz ) wedding"
