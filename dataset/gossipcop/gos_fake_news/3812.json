My sister is very Catholic, and I ’ m not. So I liked the dynamic of Scully being very Catholic and Mulder not ; I related to that. ” What Nielsen didn ’ t know at the time was that her episode would shift back one to become the penultimate episode of the season and potentially the series as a whole.
