    "text": "( CNN ) The family of Bill Paxton believes his death last year was preventable, according to a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the family against the hospital and surgeon who treated the late actor. Paxton, whose career credits included roles in ` ` Titanic,'' ` ` Aliens,'' and HBO's ` ` Big Love,'' died February 25, 2017, just days after undergoing heart surgery. He was 61. Paxton's family alleges the surgeon used ` ` a high risk and unconventional surgical approach with which he lacked experience'' and that the hospital and surgeon, ` ` misrepresented and / or concealed information relating to the risks of surgery,'' according to the suit. They believe those factors contributed to Paxton's post - surgery complications. ` `"
