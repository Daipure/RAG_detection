Jennifer Lopez walked into the Guess headquarters in downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday night looking radiant in a blue dress as she officially launched her new worldwide ad campaign with the iconic brand. The timing for the artist, who was joined at the event by her boyfriend Alex Rodriguez, couldn't have been more awkward. In an Instagram post just hours before, model Kate Upton had accused Guess creative director Paul Marciano of sexual and emotional harassment. During Wednesday's launch event, several representatives for the clothing brand were asked if there was an official statement regarding Upton's allegations on behalf of anyone for Guess or Marciano himself, but none was provided."
