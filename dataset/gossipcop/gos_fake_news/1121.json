    "text": "Once billed as a limited series, HBO is bringing Big Little Lies back for a second season. The Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman vehicle was originally developed as a movie, with both actresses ( and exec producers ) buying the rights to Liane Moriarty's book. Following the critical response — the seven - episode season covered all of Moriarty's source material — HBO put a second season in development with showrunner David E. Kelley set to return. After taking home an Emmy and Golden Globe for best limited series, Big Little Lies season two will now compete in the drama category when it returns in 2019. Here are all the details — so far — about season two of Big Little Lies. THR will update this page when more details ( like casting and a premiere date ) become available."
