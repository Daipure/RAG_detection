    "text": "Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake have been married for 6 years already! And their son is 3! It doesn ’ t seem like that much time has passed, and every time we see them together, they look like newlyweds – so what keeps their spark alive? Biel spilled some of their secrets in a recent interview. “ You just have to make time for date night, time for yourself alone and time with your partner – it has to be fun! ” She explained, “ My husband always says, ‘ We can ’ t stop dating. ’ I love that because it ’ s true. You have to continue to make the space for yourself and your partner to just have fun like you did before you had kids. And not talk about them! Keep it fresh, keep it exciting. Spontaneous if at all"
