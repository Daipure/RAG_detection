    "text": "Once Upon a Time ‘ s “ happily ever after ” is coming sooner than expected ; the ABC drama ’ s current seventh season will be its last. “ Seven years ago, we set out to create a show about hope, where even in the darkest of times, a happy ending would always be possible, ” Adam Horowitz and Eddy Kitsis, the creators and executive producers of Once Upon a Time, said in a statement Tuesday. “ But we never imagined the happy ending that was actually in store for all of us — years and years of adventure, romance, magic and hope. We ’ re so grateful to our brilliant collaborators — the cast, crew, and writers — as well as our partners at the studio and network for making this journey possible. But most of all, we want to thank the fans. Their fierce loyalty"
