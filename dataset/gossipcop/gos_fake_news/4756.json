    "text": "The formidable Kim Kardashian West's 38th birthday is this Sunday, October 21, and in celebration of the reality TV and business mogul's latest trip around the sun, we decided to take a look back on her life in makeup. After all, Kim K. has one of the most recognizable makeup aesthetics in the world. As far as the mainstream beauty consumer is concerned, she basically put contouring on the map. But a sculpted complexion and smoky eye weren't always her signature. Do a little digging, and you'll find that even though Kim definitely loved makeup from a young age, it took some time ( and a legendary partnership with makeup artist Mario Dedivanovic ) for her to nail down her look and earn her place as a makeup icon. Want to see Kim"
