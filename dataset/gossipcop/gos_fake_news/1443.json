    "text": "Orlando Bloom celebrated his 41st birthday with Leonardo DiCaprio by attending the third race of the Formula E season in Marrakesh, Morocco on Friday. The Lord of the Rings star came to do more than watching, as he got behind the wheel of one of the high - speed electric race cars. Bloom might have been a touch star - struck as he suited up to take a photo with Alejandro Agag, founder and CEO of Formula E as well as legendary French Formula One driver Alan Prost. The Brit went all out with the car racing themed birthday blowing out candles of his epic race car cake. Bloom celebrated his birthday with his father Colin at his side, who couldn â€™ t have looked more proud, cheering his son from the sidelines. Happy birthday Orlando!"
