    "text": "If Matt Lauer is looking for sympathy in the wake of his firing from Today over inappropriate sexual behavior, he's not going to find any with Seth Meyers. On Thursday's Late Night, Meyers ripped into Lauer and the allegations made against him in a Variety article. Among other things, Lauer allegedly gave a female colleague a sex toy, accompanied by a note saying that he wanted to use it on her. ` ` As a general rule, if you're giving someone a dildo at work, you're the dildo at work,'' Meyers said."
