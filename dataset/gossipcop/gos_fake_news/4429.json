    "text": "Earlier this week, Dolce & Gabbana designer Stefano Gabbana commented on a picture of Selena Gomez to call her ugly. Miley Cyrus isn't about to stand for that, and she voiced her opinion on the matter via Instagram comments. One of Miley's fan accounts posted this picture a day ago, of Selena and Miley at an event together. And Miley commented on the picture more than once, writing ` ` Well what that d * ck head said ( if it ’ s true ) is f * king false and total bull sh * t.'' In another comment, she wrote, “ She fine as f * ck. ” Here's a screenshot of the comments, because obviously receipts are important : Instagram @ MileyOff"
