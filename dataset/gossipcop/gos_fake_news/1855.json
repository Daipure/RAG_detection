Following the divorce from his ex - wife, Luann De Lesseps, the Real Housewives Of New York City alum has found himself at the front of headlines once again. In a report from Page Six, the publication claims the police are investigating him after a confrontation inside of a restaurant in Palm Beach. However, another source stated neither Tom or his lawyers have spoken to police about such an inquiry. The source claimed, “ there were a lot of people who saw what happened, ” and the man who got into a fight with him is known around the town. The perpetrator allegedly put his hands on Tom ’ s girlfriend, and after he got involved, there were drinks thrown at each other."
