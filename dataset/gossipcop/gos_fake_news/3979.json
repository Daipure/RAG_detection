    "text": "As we approach the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, it's always good to remember and reflect on all of the new friends you met along the way. And over here at The Daily Dish, that means looking back on all of the Real Housewives we've had the pleasure of meeting and getting to know this year. Since March 21, 2006 when The Real Housewives of Orange County originally premiered, more than 100 women have been given the prestigious title of Real Housewife. In 2018 alone, we met nine new Housewives, with five out of the seven franchises welcoming new additions this year. Look back on all of the lovely ladies we met this year, and we guarantee you'll fall in love with them all over again. Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave The Real Housewives of Beverly"
