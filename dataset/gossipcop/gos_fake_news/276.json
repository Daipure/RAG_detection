    "text": "A week after his casting in the upcoming “ Hellboy ” film sparked a “ whitewashing ” uproar, British actor Ed Skrein has decided to exit the project. “ I accepted the role unaware that the character in the original comics was of mixed Asian heritage, ” Skrein said in a lengthy statement Monday on Twitter. “ It is clear that representing this character in a culturally accurate way holds significance for people, and that to neglect this responsibility would continue a worrying tendency to obscure ethnic minority stories and voice in the Arts. ” Skrein — previously best known for a role in “ Deadpool ” — made headlines after it was announced on Aug. 21, that he would play Major Ben Daimio, a Japanese - American ex - Marine in the original comic book series by Mike Mignola."
