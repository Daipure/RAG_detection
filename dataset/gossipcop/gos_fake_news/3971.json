    "text": "Hello, I am rescuing my first puppy next Monday. She'll be 11. 5 weeks when we get her, and I've never had a dog that young. The people fostering her are feeding her litter 3 / 4 cup twice a day. She's an Australian shepherd / great pyrenees / golden retriever mix. I keep reading mixed things about feeding them twice or three times a day. Which do you recommend? And if it is three times a day, given that she's almost three months old, how much would you feed her each time? I have an appointment with a vet on that Friday, but wanted to ask you what you thought, hoping to get an answer before I pick her up. Thanks so much in advance! I'm really excited to take on this challenge,"
