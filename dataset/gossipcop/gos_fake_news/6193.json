    "text": "Birthday love! Kylie Jenner went all - out for boyfriend Travis Scott ’ s birthday. The makeup mogul rented out Six Flags Magic Mountain on Saturday, April 28, just a few days before the rapper turns 26 on Monday, April 30. The couple and their friends headed to the amusement park wearing matching customized hoodies with the “ Goosebumps ” rapper ’ s birthday printed on them. The group enjoyed a customized cake shaped like a roller coaster, which had tiny replicas of the pair with their 2 - month - old daughter, Stormi Webster, on the ride. The Life of Kylie star, 20, also gave an ode to Scott ’ s hometown of Houston, Texas, by turning Magic Mountain park in California into AstroWorld, which closed down in his city in 2005. Kim Karda"
