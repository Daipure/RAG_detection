The pair, who was known to fight often during their relationship, had a very public ` ` argument'' that resulted in Rob posting nude pictures of Chyna across social media ( without her permission ). On the next episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, two of Rob's sisters, Khloe and Kim Kardashian, will be discussing the incident on TV for the first time."
