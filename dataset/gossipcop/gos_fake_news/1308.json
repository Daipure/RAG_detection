The 25 - year - old Teen Mom OG cast member just returned home from six weeks of treatment Saturday, where she reunited with husband Tyler Baltierra and daughter Novalee, 2, after revealing in November she was experiencing suicidal thoughts. On Sunday, Baltierra shared a photo of a tag from a Christmas gift from her first daughter with the handwritten message, ` ` To Catelynn, from Carly, love you Merry Christmas.'' Most precious thing ever!! A post shared by Catelynn Lowell ( @ catelynnmtv ) on Dec 31, 2017 at 7 : 33"
