    "text": "Shannon Beador is starting off this season of The Real Housewives of Orange County in the midst of one of the hardest things anyone would ever have to go through : divorce. The last time we saw Shannon at the Season 12 RHOC reunion, she had announced that she and her husband, David Beador, had separated after 17 years of marriage. This season of RHOC kicks off as Shannon is in the midst of divorce proceedings with David. She officially filed for divorce from David on December 1, 2017. Even though Shannon is still going through the process of divorce today, she said she is in a much better place than when we last saw her during that emotionally raw reunion. ` ` Life today at this very moment couldn't be better. I am honestly happy. And it's not me trying to convince anybody"
