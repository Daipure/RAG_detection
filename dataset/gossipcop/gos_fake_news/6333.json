Thursday, his brother, Valentin Chmerkovskiy, and his girlfriend and ` ` DWTS'' colleague, Jenna Johnson, announced their engagement. In a simple, straightforward tweet from Venice, Italy, Johnson wrote : ` ` # ENGAGED @ iamValC,'' which is Chmerkovskiy's Twitter handle. But it's the two accompanying pictures that really stir the emotions."
