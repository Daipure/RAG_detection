    "text": "Advertisement Prince Harry was pictured kissing and tenderly embracing his girlfriend Meghan Markle at the closing ceremony of his Invictus Games Saturday night - but hid her in a darkened VIP box. The 36 - year - old actress arrived with her best friend, Canadian stylist Jessica Mulroney, wearing a white coat over a black outfit and the two women took their places in the discreet box to the side of the stage. Meghan's closest male friend, Markus Anderson, who introduced her to Harry last year, was by her side. Miss Markle - who was wearing a $ 68 pair of Everlane jeans, a $ 178 Badgley Mischka jacket and Jimmy Choo shoes - was also accompanied by her mother, Doria Ragland, a therapist and yoga teacher from LA."
