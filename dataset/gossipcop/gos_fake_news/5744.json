    "text": "Last week, Blink - 182 drummer Travis Barker was involved in a “ really bad car accident. ” Barker was driving his son Landon Asher when he was hit by a school bus. No one was hurt in the accident, but Barker ’ s car was totaled. On Saturday, he told E! News at Beautycon, “ Yesterday, I was in a really bad car accident, but I came out unscathed, which is pretty awesome. My car is totaled but I pretty much walked away okay, which is awesome. A school bus ran a red light. It was insane. I have a really big 4x4 G - Wagon and if I wasn't in that, it might have been different, but it held up pretty well. ” Landon wrote on Instagram, “ Life ’ s crazy."
