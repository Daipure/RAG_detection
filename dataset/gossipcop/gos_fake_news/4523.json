    "text": "All four of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip's kids were pretty much raised exclusively by nannies. Shortly after their daughter Princess Anne was born, when their son Prince Charles was only three years old, both parents went on a six - month Commonwealth tour, leaving their kids behind with ` ` the help.'' When the couple came back, they greeted their attention - starved children not with hugs but with handshakes. Years later when Charles was sick at school, bedridden with Asian flu, his loving parents didn't even visit him."
