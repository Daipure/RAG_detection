As the second day of New York Fashion Week commenced, Julianne Moore, Sienna Miller, Anna Wintour and other fashion VIPs gathered in an indoor rose garden to watch models display the new collection. While the paisley prints, midi dresses and outerwear with pops of color easily got our attention, it was the impeccably dressed, diverse front row that made us want to gift our friends with Tory Burch for the rest of the year. We want our friend group to look and be this kickass."
