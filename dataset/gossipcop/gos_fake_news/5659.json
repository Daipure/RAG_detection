    "text": "Ever since Kylie Jenner gave birth to her daughter, Stormi Webster, she has been posting tons of photos and videos of her baby girl on social media. But it looks like she's putting a pause on the precious posts. Kylie posted a makeup free selfie to her Instagram last night where you can see a small part of baby Stormi's head, but none of her face. She captioned the photo ` ` i spy with my little eye....'' When one user commented that Kylie ` ` cut her baby out'', the new mom wasted no time, replying ` ` yeah I cut my baby out. I'm not sharing photos of my girl right now.'' Instagram account @ commentsbycelebs caught the interaction : Now, scrolling though"
