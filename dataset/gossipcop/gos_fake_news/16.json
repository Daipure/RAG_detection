    "text": "To say Shia LaBeouf ’ s latest film has had an uneventful theatrical run would be an understatement. The actor ’ s Man Down, a drama about a U. S. Marine returning home from war, had a limited release in U. S. theaters in December that ultimately made less than half a million dollars domestically after opening to mostly poor reviews. But that domestic total practically qualifies as blockbuster status compared to how the film was received on the other side of the pond. The movie, which also stars Kate Mara and Jai Courtney, opened an extremely limited run in just one U. K. theater by selling just a single ticket in its debut, according to several reports. The Hollywood Reporter added on Wednesday that the film eventually improved on that total by selling another pair of tickets at that same theater"
