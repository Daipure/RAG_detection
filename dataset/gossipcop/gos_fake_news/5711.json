NBC even hung out the possibility of a movie to wrap up that cliffhanger that season two ended on. Alas for fans of the show, it appears none of that will happen. Timeless co - creator Shawn Ryan informed fans on Monday via Twitter that the program is, in all likelihood, done.'' @ SPTV has notified @ TheRealKripke and me that efforts to land # Timeless at another network have sadly failed. While Sony will continue to look at any and all options, actor deals have expired and it appears there will be no Season 3 or beyond,'' Ryan tweeted. ` ` Discuss"
