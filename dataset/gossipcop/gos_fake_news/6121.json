Lest you forget that the Marvel Cinematic Universe continues to expand, a new trailer for “ Ant - Man and the Wasp ” is here to remind you that our eventual heat death is at least a few years away. Paul Rudd ’ s bite - sized superhero becomes the latest Avenger - adjacent hero to get the sequel treatment in the film, which upgrades Evangeline Lilly ’ s character from civilian to sidekick. Watch the trailer below. Set between “ Captain America : Civil War ” and the just - released “ Avengers : Infinity War ” ( so much war! ), the film follows Scott Lang / Ant - Man as he deals with being placed under house arrest in further proof that no good deed goes unpunished.
