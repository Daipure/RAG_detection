A self - proclaimed ` ` Guardian of the Galaxy'' received an out of this world response from NASA after applying for a position with the space agency. This week, 9 - year - old Jack Davis of New Jersey wrote a letter to NASA to apply for planetary protection officer, a position that has been around since the 1960s. ` ` My name is Jack Davis and I would like to apply for the planetary protection officer job,'' the fourth - grader wrote in a letter. ` ` I may be nine, but I think I would be fit for the job.'' Davis also listed a few of his qualifications for the open position, one of them being that his sister calls him an alien."
