The song – which also features Cardi B, Charli XCX and Bebe Rexha – was released last month. It quickly faced backlash from the LGBTQ + community, with pop singer Hayley Kiyoko and R & B artist Kehlani criticising the track for being “ downright tone - deaf. ” Kiyoko later released a statement claiming that the song “ does more harm than good for the LGBTQ + community ” and Kehlani hit out at the song for its “ harmful lyrics ”. A video for the track has been released and features a hologram of Cardi B kissing Ora. You can watch it below. Ora"
