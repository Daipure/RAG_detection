    "text": "Selena Gomez made her first public appearance since the Met Gala yesterday, appearing at Puma's Defy City Los Angeles event in the Paramount Studios lot to celebrate the brand's new Defy shoe. Gomez met a ton of fans and managed to make another good joke at her Met Gala spray tan that drew a lot of critical tweets because it didn't photograph well on the red carpet. ` ` I fixed it from Met Gala,'' she quipped of her bronze glow to fans complimenting her appearance. Gomez's first joke about the tan was posted three days after the Met Gala. ` ` Me when I saw my pictures from MET,'' she wrote with a shrug emoji and footage of her running away.
