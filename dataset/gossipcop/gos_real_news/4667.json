    "text": "As noted in Variety, Chris Pratt will be receiving $ 10 million for his work in Universal / Comcast Corp.'s Jurassic World : Fallen Kingdom, while Bryce Dallas Howard will be getting $ 8 million. As I wrote on Tuesday, it was a surprisingly solid example of relative parity. Yes, ten is more than eight, and both actors co - starred in the last Jurassic World movie, but this was a case of franchise - specific value versus proven star power and then coming out mostly even. I was pleasantly surprised and chalked it up as a win. Those considering it a moral outrage or an example of gender - based pay disparity are treating a victory as a defeat. That she got anywhere near Pratt's salary for the second Jurassic World movie counts as a sign that this conversation is having a positive effect"
