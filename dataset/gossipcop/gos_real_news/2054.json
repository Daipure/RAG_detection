Lindsay didn ’ t have a ticket so instead hung out backstage with everyone except Taylor Swift. “ Lindsay just turned up and no one really knew what to do with her. There was a big room backstage to hold Katie Holmes and the other celebrity presenters but Lindsay wasn ’ t presenting or introducing anyone. All the musical artists had their own dressing rooms but Lindsay wasn ’ t performing. She was left to just wander around backstage, ” sources tell Straight Shuter. “ Ed Sheeran was kind enough to stop and take pictures with Lindsay but Taylor Swift wanted nothing to do with her. Taylor ’ s dressing room was where all the cool kids were hanging out. Ryan"
