After ending her “ extremely traumatic ” marriage to Fred Armisen, the Handmaid ’ s Tale star, 34, is secretly seeing director Alex Ross Perry. “ Elisabeth was terrified of dating after she left Fred, so it helps that she and Alex started off as friends, ” says a source close to the Scientologist, who filmed Listen Up Philip and Queen of Earth with the filmmaker, 32. “ Alex has been one of Elisabeth ’ s biggest supporters and a natural confidant. People were pushing for them to hook up from the start, but judging by how inseparable they are these days, it seems to have already happened. ” Praise be!"
