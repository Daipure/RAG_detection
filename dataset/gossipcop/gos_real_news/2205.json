    "text": "Radio personality Leeann Tweeden accused Minnesota Senator and comedian Al Franken of grouping her without consent on Thursday, November 16. “ In December of 2006, I embarked on my ninth USO Tour to entertain our troops, my eighth to the Middle East since the 9 / 11 attacks, ” Tweeden began in a blog post she wrote for the California radio station KABC, where she hosts a morning talk show. “ My father served in Vietnam and my then - boyfriend ( and now husband, Chris ) is a pilot in the Air Force, so bringing a ‘ little piece of home ’ to servicemembers stationed far away from their families was both my passion and my privilege. ” “ Franken had written some skits for the show and brought props and costumes to go along with them, ” she continued."
