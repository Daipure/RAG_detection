    "text": "How sad. Another Hollywood romance allegedly bites the dust. After dating for 9 months, ‘ X - Men : First Class ’ star Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander have broken up, according to a new report. Oh no! It seems like the summer of break - ups is not over yet! The latest reported romance to fall apart is the one between Michael Fassbender, 38, and Alicia Vikander, 26. The Steve Jobs star and the Swedish actress have allegedly split after nine months together! Love is dead! Michael and Alicia have reportedly called it quits, a source tells Us Weekly. Aww, bummer. Alicia and Michael have been together for not even a year. They reportedly first met on the set of their film, The Light Between The Oceans, in late 2014"
