Page Six reports that Beverly Hills landowners have banded together to reject Bieber from renting a house in the neighborhood. An unnamed real estate agent told Page Six that Bieber “ wants to rent a big estate, but many of the owners of the big Beverly Hills properties, which are for rent, have clubbed together to agree that nobody should rent to Justin. ” The Canadian pop star is better known for upsetting his neighbors with dangerous driving and random eggings than for his house - destroying parties, but whatever the reason, Beverly Hills residents really don ’ t want him in their ‘ hood. Bieber is reportedly offering well over the asking rent — up to $ 100, 000 a month"
