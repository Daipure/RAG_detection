    "text": "The 4 : 44 Tour Jay - Z, Vic Mensa Toyota Center November 8, 2017 Expecting Jay - Z to be defiant, even at 47 is akin to asking a known superstar to go out and score 30 on a given night. It's what Jay - Z does. It's what he has done for the better part of two decades, both on stage and in music. The 4 : 44 Tour, his latest North American light jog through the classics offers, maybe for the first time, a bit of bite and added emphasis to prove something to the world. There have been numerous reports of the tour not selling out, that it isn't meeting expectations or worse, is an abject failure solely because you can find a few decent seats on Groupon or a third - party reseller."
