    "text": "Scientologist actor Danny Masterson has been accused of rape by four women — and the Church of Scientology claims it knew nothing of the allegations against its longtime member. However, people deeply connected with the church say members did have knowledge of Masterson's alleged behavior way before the media reports. Several sources told Fox News that the Church of Scientology systematically covers up misdeeds of its most prominent members — and Masterson, they say, is no exception. Chris Shelton, a former member of the Church of Scientology and Sea Org from 1987 - 2012, said the church silences members who want to take complaints to law enforcement. “ The church works to protect the church first, ” he told Fox News. He said the next most important thing to Scientologists is to protect the members of the church and its public image."
