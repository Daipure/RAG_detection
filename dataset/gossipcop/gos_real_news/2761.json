Several media outlets seemed certain that the relationship was the real deal and that Rob and Meghan had been seeing each other on the down - low for months. As more details rolled in, however, the situation became increasingly sketchy. Eventually, Rob himself took to social media to deny that he's dating Mehgan, insisting that he's never even met the troubled 27 - year - old. ` ` Wait reading online about some chick I'm dating Megan something,'' Rob tweeted. ` ` Not true never even met or heard of her before.'' The dual takeaways from this tweet seem abundantly clear"
