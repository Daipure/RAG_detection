    "text": "Fake news and fake history of family separation Straight talk By George H. Rodriguez The liberal Washington Post is joining the chorus of pro - one borders, pro - illegal immigration groups that are upset that illegal alien families are being separated by immigration officials. They write an emotional opinion piece that manipulates historical facts. Writer DeNeen L. Brown says America has a history of separating children from families. She uses Native American and black slave children as examples to compare to illegal alien children being separated from their illegal alien parents. But the differences in these three situations are great. How can anyone but a liberal blinded by misguided sympathy ignore the facts? Native Americans did not come to the U. S. illegally from a foreign country. The policy of separating children from their families was terrible because they were American and they had not done anything wrong"
