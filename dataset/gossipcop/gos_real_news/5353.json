    "text": "Prince Harry's net worth is 8 - figures. Chris Jackson - WPA Pool / Getty Images Megan Markle will be marrying into class, status, and major wealth when she ties the royal knot with Prince Harry on May 19. Before she moved across the pond, Markle was earning close to half a million dollars a year starring in the USA Network drama ` ` Suits,'' plus a five - figure income from endorsement deals and sponsorships. Her total net worth is estimated to be $ 5 million. That's a sizable contribution to bring into any marriage, but when she marries Prince Harry, their combined net worth will be more than five times that. Prince Harry's net worth is at least $ 25 million ( £18 million ) and as much as $ 40 million ( £28. 7 million )"
