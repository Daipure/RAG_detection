    "text": "What's going on between Pamela Anderson and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange? The former ` ` Baywatch'' actress has frequently been photographed visiting Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he's been living in exile since 2012 in an effort to avoid bail violation charges in the UK and extradition to the US, where he's wanted to leaking classified documents. At the end of March, the embassy revealed that it had revoked Assange's visitor privileges and access to the internet because he went against ` ` a written [ agreement ] not to issue messages that might interfere with other states.'' Reacting to the news, Anderson released a statement to the New York Post expressing her disapproval of the embassy's latest move. SEE ALSO : Vanessa Trump'went"
