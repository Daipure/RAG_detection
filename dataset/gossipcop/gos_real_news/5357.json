    "text": "Well, this is a nice surprise. Halle Berry just dropped word via Instagram that the actress will be joining the cast of the third John Wick flick. Penned by Derek Kolstad and directed by Chad Stahelski, the ( presumably ) final chapter in the Keanu Reeves action franchise is set to open on May 17, 2019. I have no idea if Berry is playing a villain or a fellow anti - hero, but A ) it's cool that the ( presumed ) female lead will be about as old the male lead ( she is 51 and he is 53, neither of them looks a day over 27 ) and B ) I'm a huge fan of Berry's recent pulp fiction endeavors ( The Call and Kidnap ), so this is pretty cool casting. Lionsgate also just announced"
