    "text": "They can no longer even pretend to make it work. For years, it ’ s been rumored that Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi have had troubles in their marriage — but an insider tells In Touch exclusively that the pair, who have been married since 2008, are officially at their breaking point, and divorce is officially inevitable. “ They ’ re not going to make it. Their roller - coaster marriage is about to derail, ” the insider tells the magazine. The reason they have held off until this point isn ’ t a coincidence : Next August marks 10 years since they tied the knot, and after making it a decade together, California law could mean Portia is entitled to more of Ellen ’ s money ( Ellen is worth an estimated $ 360 million, compared to Portia ’ s $ 20 million fortune )"
