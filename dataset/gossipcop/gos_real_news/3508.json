    "text": "Joey Potter and Pacey Witter still look crazy in love, and Dawson's Creek fans are overjoyed to the point of tears. The cast of the teen drama recently reunited to celebrate the show's 20th anniversary for a special edition of Entertainment Weekly. After reviewing the flawless photoshoot one thing stood out : Katie Holmes and Joshua Jackson looking truly, madly, and deeply in love. Holmes and Jackson played Joey and Pacey, respectively, one of the show's greatest ships, so to see them lovingly touching each other like time had damn near frozen in 2003 was A LOT to handle. Perceptive fans immediately picked up on the chemistry between the two actors and it was as if the rest of the cast wasn't even there. I still love them # DawsonsCreek"
