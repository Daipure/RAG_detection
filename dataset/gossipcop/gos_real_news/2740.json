    "text": "Jennifer Lopez was not taken to a hospital last night, despite our earlier reports. While the below images appear to show the 47 yer old singer suffered a back injury, it's not what it seems. Jennifer does a part in her Vegas act where she pretends she is tired and hurt then she races across the stage and does a dramatic knee slide. We confirmed that J Lo is fine, she was seen dancing and having fun at the after party."
