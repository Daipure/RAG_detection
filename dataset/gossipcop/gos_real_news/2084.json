The moment that makes Taylor Swift ’ s new album comes roughly two minutes and 30 seconds into “ This Is Why We Can ’ t Have Nice Things, ” the third to last song. She ’ s claiming to find reconciliation with her greatest foe Kanye West and extend an olive branch, when — psych! — she interrupts her own attempt at forgiveness to immediately rescind the offer. Taylor cackles with a confession : It ’ s all bullshit. “ I can ’ t even say it with a straight face, ” she says, cracking herself up. This is what you ’ ve been waiting for — finally, Swift has dropped the act. It ’ s her very own “ sorry not sorry ” bundled in a song that doubles as her harshest critique of Kanye West"
