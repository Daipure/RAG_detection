Amal Clooney ‘ s basically perfect — incredibly intelligent, massively successful, a humanitarian, and devastatingly beautiful. Naturally, Brad Pitt would want to be around someone like the famed human rights attorney married to his good friend, George Clooney. That ’ s why Brad allegedly sought Amal ’ s help in finding a new friend, according to an anonymous source who spoke to OK! Magazine. “ Amal knows Neri through mutual friends and thought she and Brad would be the perfect fit, ” the source said. Don ’ t get your hopes up about these new friends, though."
