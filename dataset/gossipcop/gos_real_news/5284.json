Thor Odinson, who also goes by the name of Chris Hemsworth, has ‘ threatened ’ not to come on TV host Jimmy Kimmel ’ s show after latter revealed himself for the treacherous person he is, someone who sides with team Batman. Chris Hemsworth also challenged Jimmy Kimmel to find “ another Avenger named Chris. ” It seems Kimmel, a mortal and surely not a superhero, is stuck in this altercation of superheroes and he had to choose sides. It all started with Ben Affleck, who plays Batman in DC ’ s film universe, and when he quoted a ‘ news ’ report stating that Matt Damon has replaced Ben Affleck with Chris Hemsworth as his new best friend."
