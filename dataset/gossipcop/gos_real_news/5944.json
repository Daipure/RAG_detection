    "text": "Reports have surfaced in the Justin Theroux and Jennifer Aniston split that is just plain bizarre. Apparently he ’ s now ‘ fallen ’ for Selena Gomez. The Gomez has been mates with both Justin – who ’ s 21 years her senior – and Jen for years, but apparently things have gone into lover territory for Justin and the singer. The two do share a manager, we should add, so it may be nothing more than a friendly friendship. However, sources linked to the pair have gone and suggested the two have ‘ totally fallen for each other ’ and that Justin ’ s ex Jen ‘ isn ’ t happy ’. These two have been pals, which isn ’ t awkward ( Picture : Getty Images ) Life and Style has reported the source claimed Justin and Selena ( wow, she likes Justins, eh? )"
