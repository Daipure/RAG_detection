The mama of one ( and soon to be two ) was all smiles when she stepped out in Ojai, Calif., accompanied by her sister Ashlee, her adorable daughter Maxwell, nephew Bronx Mowgli Wentz and a large group of pals. The blond beauty — who is expecting a baby boy this summer — wore a skin - tight black dress, showing off her growing belly as she gently touched her tummy. She accessorized her pregnancy chic fashion with oversized shades and a bright orange Birkin bag, looking radiant as she enjoyed the sunny afternoon."
