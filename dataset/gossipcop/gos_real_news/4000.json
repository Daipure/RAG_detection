A judge in the couple ’ s ongoing divorce case said the six children “ not having a relationship with their father is harmful to them, ” adding that “ it is critical that each of them have a healthy and strong relationship with their father and mother, ” according to court documents obtained by The Blast. The judge also ordered the “ Maleficent ” actress to provide her kids with cellphones that Pitt can call whenever he ’ d like without Jolie monitoring. She ’ s also not allowed to read their text messages with their father. The court also laid out a summer schedule for each of the children except Maddox, who is old enough to decide how much time he wants to"
