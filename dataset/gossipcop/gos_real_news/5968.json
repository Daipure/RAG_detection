    "text": "Time to party — or take a nap! Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan were up for hours on their wedding day, so it ’ s not surprising that they were a bit tired before they even hit up the evening reception. After their first post - ceremony gathering, which was hosted by Queen Elizabeth II, the couple posed alone for photographer Alexi Lubomirski outside. As if that weren ’ t pressure enough, they only had less than five minutes ( seriously, the schedule was tight! ) to get the perfect moment. “ So after we ’ d done the set up [ the family ] shots, then we all went to the reception, and if the couple were going to have any energy after that, we were going to go into the rose garden and just take some intimate quick shots, ” Lubomirski explained to reporters"
