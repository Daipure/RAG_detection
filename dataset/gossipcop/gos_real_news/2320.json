Just like Kylie, Khloe also reportedly feels really lonely while waiting to welcome her first child with basketball player boyfriend, Tristan Thompson. Much like her younger half - sister ’ s situation, it looks like Khloe ’ s road to motherhood is just a neverending nightmare. The 33 - year - old is apparently, ‘ unmotivated ’ and ‘ tired ’ all the time but that ’ s not all – she ’ s also very anxious and feels isolated in Tristan ’ s adopted hometown of Cleveland. That is definitely not good for her or her baby, but she just can ’ t help it – she feels horrible!"
