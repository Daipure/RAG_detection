    "text": "Holy Batfleck replacement rumors, Batman! Warner Bros. has slammed a ` ` categorically false'' tabloid story suggesting Christian Bale was offered $ 100 million to return as The Caped Crusader. The story in OK! quotes an unnamed ` ` insider'' who said ` ` The Dark Knight'' star was previously approached about playing Batman again a few years ago and turned it down. ` ` Now they're making it virtually impossible for him to say no. A lot of names have been thrown around, but nobody else has been offered this kind of cash.'' But it should be pretty easy to say no if it didn't happen. A spokesman for Warner Bros. told Gossip Cop the magazine's entire story was ` ` categorically false. '"
