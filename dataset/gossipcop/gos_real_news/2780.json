The singer was seen getting out of his car and checking on the injured man, who was lying on the floor and looked to be screaming in pain. Police say he accidentally struck the man with his car after leaving a singalong with the Hillsong Church group in Los Angeles. The 23 - year - old looked concerned as he tried and failed to help the man to his feet - his offer of a hand up went ignored."
