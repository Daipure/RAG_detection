    "text": "Various publications are reporting an unbelievable story that Brad Pitt underwent plastic surgery after his split from Angelina Jolie. Dr. Steve Fallek, New Jersey plastic surgeon – who has never met the actor – claims that his forehead looks smoother in recent pictures. Is it possible that one of the hottest men on the planet went under the knife? According to Cafe Mom, Dr. Fallek goes on to say that Pitt looks to have some filler in his cheeks, mouth, and around the eyes to improve the lines. Plus, an unnamed source claims that the 54 - year - old went to a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon to get Botox, fillers, and some eye work. Stories surfaced last spring that Pitt felt the divorce has taken a toll on his looks, prompting his need for a little nip and tuck."
