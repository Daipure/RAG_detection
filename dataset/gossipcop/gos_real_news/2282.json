Bradley, 40, is currently in the UK ahead of his stint in The Elephant Man at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, which kicks off next week. Clearly smitten, the blossoming couple couldn't keep their hands off of each other. Both seemed relaxed and happy, and Irina opted for a casual look in a black sweater and leggings as she hugged her beau."
