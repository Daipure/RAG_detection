    "text": "Drake is suing Pusha T for 5 Million for using Blackface photo without permission. Reports are out there that Drake and OVO will be suing Pusha T for suing the blackface photo without permission. The lawsuit is suppose to be for 5 mil. Does this mean Drake has no plans to drop another diss record? Or will he still ` ` respond'' to Pusha?"
