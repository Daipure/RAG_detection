Celebrities took to social media Friday morning to share their thoughts on the inauguration, and in some cases, suggested alternative viewing. Trump, who has not been particularly popular among the celebrity circuit, inspired a # Brownout from George Lopez. The comedian began the movement on Twitter in protest of Trump not appointing a Latino to his cabinet, which every president has done since 1988. Lopez encouraged his followers to change their avatar to a brown square in support. Tomorrow I'm going on a # Brownout in protest of @ realDonaldTrump not having a Latino appointed to his cabinet, first time since 1988 pic. twitter. com / woEyaBjkoh"
