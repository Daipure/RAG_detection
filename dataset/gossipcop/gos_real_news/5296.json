Proving that their marriage is well and truly back on track, Nicole surprised Keith by joining him on stage for a touching duet during the Spotify Fans First event in Nashville last week. People reported that the 50 - year - old Aussie actress interrupted Keith from backstage, and when he recognised her voice, he called her up saying : ‘ You can come and sing it with me. ’ The pair then sang the romantic ballad together, with Keith later sharing a clip of the performance on Instagram."
