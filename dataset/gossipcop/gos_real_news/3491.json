    "text": "Taylor Swift's Reputation has just surpassed two million sales, making it the first album to do so since Adele's 25 in 2015. Currently in its 18th week of release, it's also only one of two albums from last year to sell more than one million copies, Ed Sheeran's รท being the other, according to Nielsen tracking figures. Reputation hit the milestone in its first week of release, selling 1. 2 million copies. All of Swift's six previous studio albums - 1989, Red, Speak Now, Fearless, and Taylor Swift - sold more than two million copies. However, Forbes pointed out that, interestingly, it took significantly longer for Reputation to hit that phenomenal milestone. In fact, longer than Swift's past three albums combined. 2014's 1989 hit"
