    "text": "Happy early Father's Day! ( June 17th, to those of you who aren't paying attention ; don't worry, dad has probably lost track too. ) Following a box - office run where it made just over its budget with a $ 33 million gross, Death Wish 2018 is coming home digitally on 4K Ultra HD May 22nd, and then Blu - ray / DVD / VOD June 5th. It's all in good time to pay tribute to your dad by letting him imagine he'd be an action hero on your behalf, if circumstances ever arose. The Blu - ray will include a commentary track by director Eli Roth and producer Roger Birnbaum, a grindhouse - style trailer, a featurette focusing on Roth's direction, extended scenes featuring deejays Mancow and Sway"
