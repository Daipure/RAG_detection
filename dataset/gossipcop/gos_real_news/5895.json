    "text": "Caitlyn Jenner lives on the outer edges of Malibu, up a winding, tree - lined road leading to a modern mountaintop home. Her yellow Labrador, Bertha, happily skips across the white tile floors of her living room. The kitchen is pristine, with a refrigerator stocked with bottles of water and a counter holding a platter of chocolate - chip cookies and a bowl of M & Ms. The world â€™ s most famous transgender woman has retreated from the public spotlight that once engulfed her and the hounding paparazzi who once tracked her every move. In her first lengthy sit - down magazine interview in more than a year, Jenner speaks with Variety about her conscious choice to focus, unheralded, on being a behind - the - scenes advocate for transgender rights on Capitol Hill."
