    "text": "Jennifer Aniston is not getting back with any of her ex - husbands. According to Radar Online, the ` ` Cake'' star wanted to get back with Justin Theroux after failing to reconcile with Brad Pitt. ` ` Jen wants Justin to reconsider the split, even it's only for a trial period,'' an unidentified source told the publication. ` ` Jen â€™ s done a lot of meditating and says she forgives Justin for messing her around so badly. She's keen to move on and forge a good relationship with him, instead of arguing over money or slinging mud back and forth among their mutual friends,'' the alleged insider continued. ` ` Right now if he'd give her another chance she'd take him back in a heartbeat.''"
