    "text": "Rita Ora is many things : an actress, a fashion designer, a model, a muse, a TV personality and a singer. Sadly, she is not royalty and doesn't seem to be in line for any royal title. She is, however, proudly British, which is perhaps why she seems wholly unimpressed with her obvious crush Prince Harry's polarizing new girlfriend, Meghan Markle. Appearing on The Wendy Williams Show on December 9 in promotion of the new season of America's Next Top Model, Ora seemed to cast a little shade Markle's way when the topic of Prince Harry's romantic endeavors was brought up. When asked by Wendy if she thought the prince and the American television actress may eventually get married, Ora seemed bewildered by the possibility."
