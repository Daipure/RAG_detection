Kidneys play a critical role in the body — acting as the body's filtering system, removing wastes, and controlling blood pressure - - and once they fail dialysis or a kidney transplant are needed just to stay alive. NKF CEO, Kevin Longino, said, “ Kidney disease has been part of my own life for as long as I can remember, affecting three generations of my family. I am alive today because of the kidney transplant I received 13 years ago from an anonymous deceased donor — and there isn ’ t a day that goes by when I do not give thanks to the family who, despite their tragic loss, allowed me to live."
