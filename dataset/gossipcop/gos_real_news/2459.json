On last Sunday ’ s BET awards, it was quite clear that Jay - Z and Beyonce were not buddy, buddy with Kim Kardashian. In fact, the camera caught Jay barely acknowledge Kim when he was going on stage to accept his award with Kanye West. Since Jay and Kanye are not only music collaborators but close friends, will “ Kimye ” stand a chance? Unfortunately, Kim can not make Kanye ’ s friends like her. It will be Kanye ’ s responsibility to lay the law down with his buddies. He must let it be known that high school"
