    "text": "Pretty much from the time they started dating, rumors of Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus getting married have been circulating non - stop. And in fairness, they really did seem to move rather quickly from the very beginning. Of course, there's still the minor obstacle of the fact that Ben is technically still married to Jennifer Garner, but it seems Affleck and Shookus won't allow that pesky little detail to stand in their way. According to Radar Online, Ben and Lindsay are currently in the process of planning a Hawaiian wedding. “ They want to do it before the end of summer when Lindsay goes back to work on SNL, ” an insider tells the site. “ They love Hawaii and had a great time there in April when Ben was filming Triple Frontier. ”"
