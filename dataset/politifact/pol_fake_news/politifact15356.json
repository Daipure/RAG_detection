Liberals were too quick to disperse this shocking picture, as proof of President Donald Trump’s cruelty. But their incredible blunder just backfired. Now, they’re screwed.\n\nThe answer, naturally, is a resounding no. Democrats will do anything to undermine the president’s work. That includes being underhanded, manipulative, and cruel as possible.\n\nWithin the course of Trump’s period in office, we have seen liberals do some shockingly dreadful things. They’ve insulted his wife by criticizing her intelligence, state of origin, as well as her accent, demonstrating who the real racists and sexists are.\n\nLiberals didn’t hesitate to question his children’s psychological health, even calling Barron handicapped. That is not even mentioning the numerous times that left handed outlets edited videos or photos to create Trump look like a poor guy.\n\nHowever, what they did that this weekend actually takes the cake. A photo went viral throughout Twitter. The dreadful picture depicted arrested illegal immigrants. These individuals — arrested by our government — were made to stay in cages resembling dog kennels.\n\nIt is too bad that these liberals did not bother to check the date on the film.\n\nEx-Obama staffer Jon Favreau, in a now-deleted conversation, linked to a AZCentral.com article titled,”First glance of immigrant kids at holding facility” and said”This is occurring right now, and the only argument that issue is the way we force our government to get these kids back to their families as quickly as possible”\n\nHis obvious intent was to slam the Trump government for its treatment of unaccompanied minors taken into custody at the border. [Source: Twitchy]\n\nJon Favreau was among many liberals who assaulted Trump within this injustice. The famous Hollywood actor and director once worked for Obama as his speechwriter. So I guess he understood how better things were under the last government, right? This liberal celebrity is likely horrified every day over what he sees coming from the White House. I mean, that could let something as bad as this:\n\nHow dreadful! Certainly the guy responsible for this is a total racist, who hates brown people. Liberals have every right to spread this photograph to as many people as possible.\n\nBut wait, let’s look at the initial post. It was from ACCentral.com. As stated by the date, this was composed in 2014.\n\nThat’s right, liberals. This photograph you are so outraged more than was taken through Obama’s administration.\n\nLiberals were not storming Twitter with demands for change. They were not calling Obama racist for treating kids like this. Why weren’t the overlords inside the mainstream press requiring answers from his government?\n\nAppears like liberals didn’t care when Obama mistreated illegals. Yet they accuse Trump of racism, dependent on nothing. All Trump wants to do is protect our border from crime and terrorism.\n\nHe is not treating illegals like creatures. However, while Trump calls vile MS-13 members”animals,” Obama was treating children like creatures. Really makes you think.\n\nLiberals, in their own feverish hatred for Trump, unwittingly outed among Obama’s numerous sins. And their own. They pretend to care, as a response to Trump’s stance on immigration.\n\nBefore Trump suggested the wall, liberals did not think twice about illegals. We all know that for a fact since this article has been around for FOUR decades, and they have said nothing.\n\nFeatured Image Source H/T: MadWorldNews\n\nLike this: Like Loading..."
