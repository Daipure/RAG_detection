According to news reports at the time, the mosque had raised more than $340,000 in cash and supplies “for the victims of Hurricane Harvey.” All of that will now be sent overseas to Syria to “help” people in refugee camps, which have been repeatedly identified as breeding grounds for ISIS recruitment.\n\n“We intended to send it to the people impacted by the hurricane,” Alkalb said when asked if he lied about his intent when asking for donations from the community. “But after much prayer, Allah told us that we must help the people who need it most.”\n\nResidents are outraged, demanding that Alkalb return their donations but he says he will not be doing that.\n\n[adrotate banner=\"3\"]\n\nIt’s time for us to stop tolerating this stuff and make our voices heard!"
