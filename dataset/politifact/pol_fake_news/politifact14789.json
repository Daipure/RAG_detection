    "text": "13 million people over the age of 65 are about to get letters from the IRS informing them that President Trump has declared them the recipients of a Christmas stimulus to offset the horrible performance of this year’s Black Friday. To qualify, you must be over 65, retired, receive social security and have an income under $40K per year.\n\nThe stimulus, part of the yearly discretionary budget to use at the discretion of the Chief Executive, is the remainder of the till for 2017. Each recipient will receive\n\nThe letter will also come with an offer to pledge support for President Trump, a requirement the Attorney General says is perfectly legal and patriotic, though not fully enforceable. White House Director of Information and Propaganda, Art Trubolls, says the fine-print is there for a reason:\n\n“If you ask liberals to pledge support for the office of the President they’ll start burning down their own cities. Unless there’s a black man, a gay person or a woman in the Oval Office they’ll never be satisfied. They call Trump a racist but he’s vilified every day for being a white male. It’s hypocrisy at its finest.”\n\nPresident Trump already enjoys the highest approval rating of any president of all time among seniors in this country. There’s a reason for that. With age comes wisdom. Just look at President Trump’s supporters. They’re as American as it gets.\n\nThe letters will be sent sometime this coming week. If you don’t get yours, call the White House switchboard at (202) 456-1414 and let them know."
