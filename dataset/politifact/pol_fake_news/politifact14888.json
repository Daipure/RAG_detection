Under the GOP proposal, millions of American households will be at risk of losing heat this winter, as reported by the Independent.co.uk\n\nSadly, this is exactly what millions of Americans have been fearing. The Republicans are carrying out a major attack against poor people and senior citizens, all so they can give a few more tax cuts to their rich friends.\n\nAs Gray TV reported recently, “President Donald Trump proposed cutting the multi-billion-dollar program as part of his budget plan. Government estimates suggest six million people rely on it to heat, cool, or weatherize their homes.”\n\nThis is just the latest example of the Trump administration’s utter disregard for everyday people in our country. Time and time again, Trump has taken every opportunity he has to make life harder for the people in the bottom 50 percent of America.\n\nThe Republicans have spent years trying to destroy everything that makes America great. Now that they have control of the House, the Senate, and the presidency, they are ramping up their ruthless campaign to full speed.\n\nIt’s time for Americans to wake up and stand up to the stupid Republican politicians in Washington D.C. – enough is enough\n\nPlease ‘SHARE,’ to help us get the word out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\nComments\n\ncomments"
