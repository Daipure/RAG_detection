    "text": "The Second Amendment has continuously been under assault in the United States and in the United Nations. Most often, the attacks came from Democrats and other leftists who have long wanted to see a disarmed populace, with only the government and military maintaining access to firearms. Liberals know that an armed population will not willingly become slaves.\n\nThe United Nations has long worked, on an international level, to undermine the right of individuals to keep and bear arms, particularly the right of Americans to do so. In a recent document, it sounds like representatives of the United States promised “full implementation” of the UN’s gun-control agreement, and in doing so essentially forfeit the Second and Tenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Perhaps most interestingly of all, the mainstream media has been entirely silent on the issue… perhaps they don’t want to laud this win and stir up patriots?\n\nThe Third Review Conference for the UN’s Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons concluded at the end of June. Apparently, American ‘representatives’ at the conference agreed to begin developing ‘legal frameworks’ (generally, laws and regulations) that will enforce “proper management” of “small arms and light weapons” stockpiles.\n\nIt seems that this agreement also includes ‘stockpiles’ owned by American citizens.\n\nThe United Nations, an extremely corrupt international government organization with a long track record of failure and few (if any) successes to its name, is hoping that the United States will help it to track (and likely, confiscate) firearms in the country.\n\nThe conference put out a plan that included demands for a massive database of all organizations, parties, and individuals that manufacture, own, sell, trade, or transfer firearms or ammunition.\n\nThis will serve as a means for the United Nations to find ‘illicit’ ammunition and firearms.\n\nOf course, given the UN’s history of pushing for gun control measures, it’s not beyond the pale to believe that the organization would declare wide swaths of firearms illegal, or that home manufacture of ammunition for private use or resale is illegal.\n\nIf the United States passes a law, or an executive order, to compel it to cooperate with the UN’s gun control objectives, that could mean that the government would actually seize such equipment on behalf of the international agency.\n\nHowever, it gets worse still. The ‘Programme of Action’ also allows UN ‘peacekeepers’ to go to member nations to ‘assist’ in meeting the goals of the program.\n\nSo, if the organization decides that the United States should hand over its civilian-owned AR-15s for destruction, and then decides that the process is taking too long, they could send their blue helmet and beret-wearing goons to American shores to ‘help’ speed the process up.\n\nThe conference produced a list of six points to which all member states agreed.\n\nFirstly, they all agreed to establish laws in their nations to support the effective implementation of the Programme of Action (PoA).\n\nSecondly, they agreed to strengthen ‘coordinated approaches’ nationally for implementing the PoA.\n\nThirdly, they promised to include women in the mechanism related to said implementation.\n\nFourth, the representatives agreed to create a ‘national point of contact’ to act in the role of liaison between nations and the UN.\n\nFifth, they promised to ‘make better use’ of existing data to push various social and corporate policies in order to be ‘in compliance’ with UN demands concerning women, disarmament, and ‘non-proliferation,’ which generally means not making new firearms for the civilian market.\n\nFinally, they agreed to ‘significantly reduce’ illicit flows of small arms through means such as ‘voluntary surrender’ programmes and ‘illicit weapons’ recovery.\n\nIn other words, the United States government is expected to help push an absurdly anti-Second Amendment set of demands on the American people.\n\nIf they don’t push that set of rules upon the people swiftly enough, then the UN will decide if it wants to send armed peacekeepers to the nation or not.\n\nThis agreement is wildly unconstitutional, and that’s being kind. It violates the Second Amendment, obviously, by its very nature, but it goes further than that.\n\nBy requiring that state governments, county governments, and local governments bend to the wills of the federal government (and international government), it violates the Tenth Amendment, which states that powers not given to the federal government in the constitution are “reserved to the states respectively.”\n\nThe idea of a ‘liaison’ between the federal government and the UN is also legally questionable.\n\nApparently, the United States’ representative(s) don’t see a problem with this kind of unconstitutional nonsense.\n\nPerhaps it’s time that Donald Trump remove the United States from the United Nations, an organization that does little more than take money from America and hands it to corrupt nations via poorly-run bureaucracies.\n\nPerhaps, before the UN lectures America and other nations for recognizing the rights of their citizens to keep and bear arms, it should look at its own failures to stop the ‘illicit firearms trade.’\n\nUN Peacekeeper operations are infamous for leaving behind firearms, particularly in the third world. There’s a reason that, among the millions of Ak-pattern rifles in Africa, there are also hundreds of thousands of G3’s and CETME rifles from European militaries; the UN leaves them behind when they deploy.\n\nIf the UN pushes the issue, they’ll likely find that the United States is not so quick to acquiesce as third-world nations who constantly have their hands out for ‘free’ stuff. If they’re going to attempt to undermine the laws of a nation, perhaps they should no longer operate out of the nation with legal immunity."
