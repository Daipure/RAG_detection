The news, just picked up for a special edition of Hannity tomorrow, could unravel the evil empire once and for all.\n\nHis name is Wilshire Williams — or at least that’s the alias he’s used for more than 40 years. He was a low-level runner for the mafia until he was literally sold to Bill Clinton in exchange for 12 cases of confiscated Arkansas moonshine. Clinton was the State Attorney at the time. He and Williams, who was born Terrence Wilekenmeyer in Yonkers, became close.\n\nWilliams, who knows that while he was invited to their barbeques and kept comfortable and out of the spotlight for 40 years he was nothing but a tool, says that he is dying of pancreatic cancer and that he needs to go with a clean conscience. The intern at Fox that took the interview for Hannity told our reporter:\n\n“Wilekenmeyer is the real deal. He put three bullets in Vince Foster and two in Seth Rich. He tied up more loose ends than any other hitman in history.”\n\nThe interview with Williams, which should tape in the next day or two, will be pre-empted by a short radio interview on Hannity’s show tomorrow. Wilekenmeyer has cooperated with authorities and will not be arrested until after his stories can all be corroborated, which won’t be nearly fast enough to beat the cancer riddling his body. Doctors say he has less than a week to live.\n\nHopefully, all of the evidence this man says he has pans out and a dying declaration is enough. Not having your star witness among the living is how the Clintons have escaped prosecution for 40 years."
