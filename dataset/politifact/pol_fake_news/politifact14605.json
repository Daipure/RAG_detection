I don’t know what to say. Sonny was the most kind-hearted, loving man I have ever met,” she added in a statement to radio station WCYB.\n\nThe couple both worked at the Henry County Medical Center in Paris, Tenn. — he was a registered nurse and she is an orthopedic surgeon, the hospital said in a statement.\n\nMelton “checked in” at the event on his Facebook page Friday night — and condolences flooded the post’s comments thread Monday.\n\nDays before, his wife had posted a photo of the smiling couple wearing matching Eric Church shirts — Route 91’s headline act."
