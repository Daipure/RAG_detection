This prompted Trump to send a massive warning to Obama and his deep state minions that they won’t soon forget!\n\nMad World News reported that Obama just jetted off to New Zealand this week, and he immediately imposed a strict ban on the media covering the events he plans to hold there. It should come as no surprise that Obama chose to leave the country right now, however, as the heat was just turned up on his deep state after the firing of now former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.\n\nIn the wake of this firing, it was confirmed that Obama left behind a trail of damning evidence inside the Oval Office. The evidence proves that it was actually the Obama administration that colluded with Russia to thwart then-candidate Donald Trump during the presidential election, and they didn’t cover their tracks well enough.\n\nThe members of Obama’s deep state that took part in this plan included ormer FBI Director James Comey, former National Security Advisor Susan Rice, former UN Ambassador Samantha Powers, and Lisa Monaco, who was the head of the DOJ National Security Division. Monaco slipped up and left an evidence trail going from the illegal unmasking of US citizens being done, Trump and his campaign people, under the illegal FISA warrants, back to the Oval Office via the “Presidential Daily Briefings” (PDB).\n\n“During the 2015/2016 presidential election, Lisa Monaco was one of the key WH figures doing the unmasking of raw intelligence provided by the ‘small group’ collaborators (with Susan Rice, Ben Rhodes). Monaco was also one of the key policy strategists, heck, she was the architect, who utilized the compartmentalization of intelligence to hide the fingerprints of collaboration. This was the issue that initially stymied HSPCI Devin Nunes,” reported The Conservative Treehouse.\n\nNunes eventually found Obama’s PDBs which have all the illegal FISA activity and other illegal spy games targeting Trump.\n\n“Nunes stated the intelligence product he reviewed was ‘not related to Russia, or the FBI Russian counter-intelligence investigation.’ So the product itself was likely a product for the President, that was not part of the ongoing FBI counter-intel product,” reported The Conservative Treehouse.\n\nThese PDBs prove Obama was in on this from the very beginning, and he hasn’t stopped trying to take Trump down since then. Last month, Obama and his deep state set up a website called “National Security Action,” who says their mission is, “Under President Trump’s reckless leadership, the United States is weaker in the world, less safe, and more isolated. He is retreating from the world stage, undercutting the intelligence and law enforcement agencies that keep us safe, undermining the diplomacy that prevents wars, insulting our allies, attacking democratic traditions, and cozying up to dictators while abandoning America’s commitment to universal rights and human dignity.”\n\nThese people are just trying to get Trump impeached so they can swoop in and take back the White House as soon as he is out of it. Unfortunately for them, however, McCabe’s firing makes it clear that they won’t get away with this act of treason.\n\nWhat do you think about this? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section."
