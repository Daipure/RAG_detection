Moore has been hated passionately by the left for decades, for his consistent dedication to biblical morality.\n\nConsider how suspicious this is – a woman comes forward 39 years later with a vicious never-before-made accusation – and how is one suppose to defend oneself and prove it is a lie 39 years later? Welcome to politics in America.\n\nThe establishment doesn’t want Roy Moore, a man who can’t be bought or bribed, to pull up their political skirts and overturn their tables of corruption and greed! Roy Moore will win big! Buckle up RINOS…time to meet a real man!\n\nKayla Moore, Roy Moore’s wife, in an exclusive statement to The Activist Mommy yesterday, told us that “The Washington Post has been calling and harassing our friends and family, trying to find garbage. We’ve had people back home telling us they are getting phone calls and when they would tell them good things, the Washington Post would ask them if they knew anything bad on him.”\n\nWell, her story continues to be corroborated, as witnesses have come forward saying the Washington Post, a paper that has officially endorsed Jones, has actually been bribing people to dig up dirt on Moore!\n\nGo figure! This is exactly what Kayla claims has been happening.\n\nRoy Moore had this to say about the fabricated campaign against him:\n\nThe Obama-Clinton Machine’s liberal media lapdogs just launched the most vicious and nasty round of attacks against me I’ve EVER faced!\n\nWe are in the midst of a spiritual battle with those who want to silence our message. The forces of evil will lie, cheat, steal –– even inflict physical harm –– if they believe it will silence and shut up Christian conservatives like you and me.\n\nI believe you and I have a duty to stand up and fight back against the forces of evil waging an all-out war on our conservative values!\n\nOur nation is at a crossroads right now — both spiritually and politically.\n\nOur children and grandchildren’s futures are on the line.\n\nSo rest assured — I will NEVER GIVE UP the fight!\n\nThe Democrats always pull this stunt. Ever since they saw it work for the Clintons they’ve been trying it every chance they get! But they completely underestimate Roy Moore and the people of God.\n\nThis is a last-ditch, hail mary pass effort from the Democats to slander a man they’ve hated as long as he has held public office. This fabricated story can’t hold water for long!\n\nThis statesman is going through the fires of testing for the survival of this nation. Let us all pray for him and give him our most generous support right now. Visit RoyMoore.org now!!\n\nLike a club or a sword or a sharp arrow is one who gives false testimony against a neighbor. (Proverbs 15:18)"
