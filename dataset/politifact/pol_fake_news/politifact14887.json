Orrin Hatch (R-UT) stated that Trump had “been one of the best presidents” he ever served under.\n\nO’Neal stated “I’m not aware of it. I don’t pay much attention to his tweets. I’ll say this for you. He’s been one of the best presidents I’ve served under.”\n\nAND THE REASONING IS, HE’S NOT AFRAID TO MAKE DECISIONS. HE’S NOT AFRAID TO TAKE ON THE — THE BIG MOUTHS AROUND HERE.”\n\nO’Neal continued, “The president is smart, powerful and a good counterpuncher.I think he attacks anyone he perceives or believes is attacking him or the country.”\n\n“He should be given the Medal of Freedom for talking his mind in such a bold, honest, and straightforward manner.” O’Neal added.\n\n“THE REALITY IS THAT PEOPLE NEED TO START FIGHTING FOR THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER WITH HIM INSTEAD OF CRITICIZING AND WASTING THEIR TIME ON STUPID THINGS.” HE CONCLUDED.\n\nAnd Also What Ken Langone told CNBC:\n\nIf President Donald Trump is able to keep defying expectations — like he did in the election — and push through legislative changes against great odds, he could go down as “one of our greatest presidents ever,” Ken Langone told CNBC on Monday.\n\nLangone, a longtime Republican supporter and the billionaire co-founder of Home Depot, said the Trump presidency offers the GOP, which also controls the House and the Senate, a unique time to deliver on the reasons Americans voted for a political outsider for the White House.\n\nVoters are “fed up,” Langone said on “Squawk Box.” “They did a very dramatic, earth-shattering thing,” and now want results, he said.\n\nLangone warned the Republicans that they could lose their majorities in the House and the Senate if lawmakers fail to seize this Trump-created opportunity. “We own the next 25 years as a nation [if we act].”\n\n“If you guys don’t get your guys into a room and say ‘Guys this is our moment.’ The American people will throw you out too, the next time,” he warned House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy who also appeared as a guest Monday on “Squawk Box.”\n\n“[Trump] has the capacity to go down as one of our greatest presidents ever” if he’s able to bring about big changes in health care, tax cuts and $1 trillion of infrastructure upgrades, Langone said.\n\n“The American people elected him president, in my mind, for one reason: they don’t want incremental change. They want major change,” said Langone, founder and CEO of investment bank Invemed Associates, specializing in health-care and high-technology companies\n\nThe Home Depot co-founder also came out in favor of the House GOP’s border adjustment tax provision to help pay for their overall effort to cut corporate taxes.\n\n\n\nMany retailers are against the idea of taxing imports, saying it will force them to raise prices.\n\nBut Langone argued that retailers, like Home Depot, would be better off in the long term if they’re able to “think beyond the next quarter or the next six months.”\n\nLike this: Like Loading..."
