The reason is simple: .com is the where most of Web traffic happens. Owning a premium .com gives you great benefits including better SEO, name recognition, and providing your site with a sense of authority.\n\nHere's What Others Are Saying Since 2005, we've helped thousands of people get the perfect domain name I was so happy to have come across Huge Domains! I had let go of my domain name years after I originally bought it due to some life changes and my business not being a priority anymore. Years later, I was not only disappointed it was being used by someone else, years after that it became available for almost $800 that required a one time payment. So happy I happened to come across Huge Domains that was not only better priced but offered a no interest payment plan. Thank you again it means the world to me! - Niki Stanley, 11/6/2017\n\nI was so happy to have come across Huge Domains!
