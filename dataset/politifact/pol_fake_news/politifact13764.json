It is unclear at this time what that agreement specifically covers.\n\nCTN has censored the couple’s address and the contact information for Hillary’s attorney in the respect of their privacy.\n\nAt this time, the Clinton’s are not commenting on the breaking news of their imminent divorce. The Clinton’s got married on October 11, 1975, in Fayetteville, Arkansas in the living room of their new red brick home. 15 of their closest friends and family were present, and the reception took place in their backyard.\n\nThe couple’s marriage has been a mystery for years after it was discovered that Bill Clinton carried on multiple affairs while Governor of Arkansas, President of the United States, and even after his time in public office.\n\nIt has been alleged in the past that the couple has a purely professional relationship and that they haven’t slept in the same bed for years\n\nsource"
