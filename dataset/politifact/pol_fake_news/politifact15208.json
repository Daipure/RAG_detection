Now that Donald Trump is in office, however, he’s blowing the lid open on the nation’s sleaziest scandals, and anything with Obama’s name on it is being looked at.\n\nRecently, a long overdue raid was conducted in South Carolina, and what was discovered is worse than we initially thought.\n\nFreedom Daily reported that the owner of a Columbia, South Carolina gas station named after Obama has been arrested and charged with tax evasion. The Department of Revenue confirmed that Murad A. Alhanik, owner of the Obama Mart on North Main Street, has been charged with four counts of sales tax evasion.\n\nOfficials say Alhanik did not pay more than $136,000 in sales taxes over four years, and that he evaded taxes by underreporting sales from 2013 to 2016.\n\n“Alhanik filed monthly sales tax returns reporting a total of $971,935 in gross sales. However, the DOR investigation revealed actual sales to be $2,688,533. Due to the underreported sales, the defendant evaded paying $136,753 in sales taxes due to the state of South Carolina,” the DOR said in a statement.\n\nClearly, just like his idol Obama, Alhanik thought he was above the law.\n\nAlhanik is facing up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine for each count.\n\nAlhanik bought the South Carolina gas station in 2011 and made headlines when he named it after Trump. He claimed that the rebranding resulted in an uptick of business.\n\n“I see more people come in,” Alhanik said. “Excited with the name.”\n\nIn January of 2017, Alhanik boasted that he would not be changing the name of the store despite Obama not being president anymore because “it’s still history.”\n\nWe’re glad to see that Alhanik has finally been brought to justice. Hopefully, his idol Obama can join him in prison soon as well!"
