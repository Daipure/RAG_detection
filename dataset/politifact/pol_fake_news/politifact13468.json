Knew there was something special about him. God is his saviour. Thank you, Denzel!\"\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nThe prevalence of fake news on Facebook has become a hot issue in the wake of the US election.\n\nAnd Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg responded to these concerns in a post on Saturday night.\n\n\"Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes,\" he said.\n\n\"The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics.\"\n\nBut it appears not all Mr Zuckerberg's own employees were satisfied with his response, as Buzzfeed news has reported that some have set up an unofficial task force to deal with the problem.\n\nThings to ask yourself before you share a claim\n\nHave I heard of the publisher before?\n\nIs this the source I think it is?\n\nHas this been reported anywhere else?\n\nIs there more than one piece of evidence for this claim?\n\nWho is American News?\n\nAmerican News has more than five million likes on Facebook.\n\nIt specialises in emotive right-wing stories.\n\nThe articles it shares on Facebook link back to its website, which contains no information about the people who write and publish the stories.\n\nThe domain registration uses a privacy service to keep the owner's identity a secret.\n\nThe BBC messaged American News for comment but has had no response.\n\nWhere did this story come from?\n\nCharacteristically for stories of this type, American News was not the first to publish it.\n\nInstead, it took it from other similar websites.\n\nAs reported by Snopes - one of the internet's oldest debunking sites - a site called ANews24 published the false claim about Mr Washington back in August.\n\nSnopes points out the words about Donald Trump attributed to Mr Washington are originally from an interview in the New York Post with civil rights activist Charles Evers.\n\nMr Evers, 93, endorsed Mr Trump in that interview, saying: \"We need more and more jobs.\n\n\"Unemployment is way up here.\n\n\"He has hired more employees, more people, than anyone I know in the world.\"\n\nHow to spot a fake US election claim\n\nby Patrick Evans, UGC & Social News team"
