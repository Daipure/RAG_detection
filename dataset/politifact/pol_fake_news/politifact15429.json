Same way I still can’t believe that Trump is in charge,” Pitt stated. “In the simplest terms, what brings us together is good, and what separates us is bad.”\n\n“What I’m most hopeful about is that we’re a global neighborhood now, and we start to understand each other more and more — and yet, you see this reactionary push for isolation and separation again,” he added.\n\n“A Trump supporter is fighting against just about everything. What does he even mean, take our country back?”\n\n“Would someone please explain that to me? Where’d it go?”\n\nWhat do you think about this?
