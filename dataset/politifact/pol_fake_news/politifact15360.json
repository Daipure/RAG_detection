    "text": "Donald does his best to play nice with his wife when the cameras are rolling, but everyone knows that his marriage is on the rocks and that their marriage essentially enslaves Melania.\n\nIn most instances, Melania appears disgusted beyond belief when she appears alongside Donald. One of the only photos she smiled in during Trump’s presidency was taken at Barbara Bush’s funeral alongside the Obamas and Clintons.\n\nThis week, Rudy Giuliani threw the nation a major curveball when he contradicted the president’s story in an interview with Fox News. He later tried to clean up the mess by claiming that Donald was only trying to protect his marriage by burying the false allegations against him.\n\nFollowing Rudy’s interview, Trump posted a multi-part tweet that had desperation written all over it. He posted the tweetstorm shortly before delivering his National Day of Prayer speech.\n\nDuring the event, people quickly noticed Melania’s absence. Did Giuliani’s already-infamous interview humiliate Melania to the point that she decided to avoid the event altogether?\n\nTrump and Giuliani are trying to sell people the thought that the $130,000 hush payment to Daniels was “personal” money disconnected from Trump’s presidential campaign.\n\nDonald wrote, “Prior to its violation by Ms. Clifford and her attorney, this was a private agreement. Money from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll in this transaction.”\n\nCheck out the tweet below:\n\n…despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair. Prior to its violation by Ms. Clifford and her attorney, this was a private agreement. Money from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll in this transaction. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 3, 2018\n\nWill Melania resist being seen with Donald publicly as she did after the first time Donald’s affair with Daniels stole headlines?\n\nWhat is your reaction?\n\n*Please let us know in the comments section below*"
