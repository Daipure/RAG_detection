    "text": "Denzel’s recent comments about the “Orwellian Police State” is so very apparent, given the FBI, DNC, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama scandal inside the administration’s treasonous activity in having the Clinton Foundation pay for a fake dossier, made by Christopher Steele and Fusion GPS, which they hoped would create false allegations which would concede Donald Trump’s Presidential victory. This fake dossier was then passed to James Comey at the FBI, who then issued FISA warrants to surveillance Donald Trump at the Trump Tower prior to the election, which later sparked Robert Mueller’s Special Counsel to investigate any Russian collusion in the 2016 Presidential Election. This, in a nutshell, exposes the spying and the treason that the DNC committed under the Obama administration to try to prevent Trump from succeeding, which is all stated in the Nunes Memo.\n\nDenzel affirmed, “If the Democrats had won the election, we never would have found out they were using false documents to get warrants to spy on American citizens and political opponents. We never would have known this. Think about it!”\n\nDenzel Washington, who has been nominated for Best Actor for the film ‘Roman J. Israel, Esq.’ (his 8th total Oscar nomination), didn’t pull any punches on the revelations of the released memo, stating: “They would have a tool they would use over and over again to circumvent the will of the people in future elections”.\n\nWhen a reporter then asked Denzel Washington if he felt the memo released by Congress on Friday was “reliable”, he responded, “Hell yeah, it’s reliable. We don’t need to know the nitty gritty to understand exactly what’s happened here”.\n\n“We know that a warrant to spy on the Trump team was issued based on media reports, and these media reports were based on information provided by an opposition research firm being paid by the DNC and Hillary Clinton.”\n\n“You guys can’t see what is wrong with this? You’re kidding me. Well I guess you are reporters. How many reporters was it that got caught colluding with the Clinton campaign?”\n\nDenzel Washington then later called out individual reporters and media outlets for never publishing anything negative about the Democrat Party, and subsequently hiding their scandals from any in-depth news output.\n\nDenzel continued, “I grew up a Democrat. I get it. I know a lot of people who hate Trump with a real passion. But you’ve got to understand that we dodged a bullet when Clinton lost. More than one bullet. We avoided the creation of an Orwellian Police State”.\n\nWe couldn’t agree more, and we thank god for Donald Trump every day, which has been our sentiment all along here at Brainstain. We also wonder why the mainstream news media is now trying to downplay the severity of the memo, as if it didn’t constitute complete treason?\n\nThe double standards are “oh so” apparent, and it’s good to see somebody high up in celebrity circles like Denzel Washington to be brave enough speak out on these pressing issues, and helping to expose the scandals of the Democrat Party."
