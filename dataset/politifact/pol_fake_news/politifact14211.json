The ranch, just a few hundred miles north of anything in Wyoming, was also seized along with a fleet of automobiles, recreational vehicles and other property now considered the spoils of the drug trade.\n\n\n\nThe bust itself yielded more than $6 million in finished drugs alone, never mind the plants and raw product waiting for packaging. All in all, Senator Lindsay is looking at 70 years behind bars on the opium alone. He was taken into custody at his office in Washington DC and has since been booked and released on $10 million bail.\n\nLindsays office isnt commenting on the ordeal but New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has already called for his removal and a special election as soon as possible. The loss of yet another seat, especially in the northeast, would be devastating to the Democrats.\n\n\n\nThe DEA says their investigation isnt over and that there are potentially more politicans involved. Well keep you updated.\n\n\n\n\n\nFake news bitches blackflip off .. __________________\n\n[QUOTE=Administrator;15106961]And exactly why its better I work in the backround and not meddle what makes pirate pirate.
